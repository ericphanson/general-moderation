      "body": "One could certainly see this as collection of convenience functions only. I agree. \r\n\r\nYet, I devloped this package with a clear work flow in mind for the application in egineering. So this package is not about just reading and writing certian cells from an excel file. Instead the following workflow is enabled for a calculation script in Julia:\r\n\r\n- An Excel spreadsheet is used to provide all the input parameters (including the physical unit) for a calulation with Julia based on `Unitful`: so the Excel file is \"just\" used to organize all the input data\r\n- Such an Excel file may look like:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4184218/224566348-678a7210-3d79-4fb6-90da-f927f0e1d53a.png)\r\n- For example, the function call `XLSXreadvar(file,\"U\")`  identifies where on sheet the variable U is stored, reads the physical quantity based on the number and unit located in the two cells located to the right of \"U\". \r\n- This way, for example, Ohm's law `R = U / I` can be applied in Julia based on real physical quanities, not just numbers.\r\n- The package `WorkflowXLSX` then also allows to write back the results to a copy of the Excel file. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4184218/224566894-41ade600-ea1d-4cba-b3df-92e4202dbc53.png)\r\n\r\nThe package `WorkflowXLSX` shall help to avoid calculations in Excel. Instead a calculation script can be created by an engineer with just little programming knowledge. \r\n",
