      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "The name similarity is not a problem. However, the package is not suitable for registration in its current form. For one, it is missing documentation. [At the very least](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/when-does-it-make-sense-to-post-a-new-package-to-the-julia-repository/108701/4), that would be a description of the package's purpose and a small usage example in the README.\r\n\r\nMoreover, distributing binary DLL files as part of the package is a no-go:\r\n\r\n* It violates the [license of the Wintun binary releases](https://github.com/WireGuard/wintun/blob/master/prebuilt-binaries-license.txt)\r\n* A raw DLL file cannot be audited by the user and thus is a security issue (especially when used with root permissions, as the package mandates)\r\n\r\nAs https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/112370#issuecomment-2267650215 mentions, the usual way of writing Julia packages that rely on non-Julia code or binary artifacts is via [BinaryBuilder](https://binarybuilder.org/). If that is done properly, I don't see that this package couldn't be merged under the name `Wintun`.\r\n",
