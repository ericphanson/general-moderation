Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: GLFW\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to SGP4. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",
