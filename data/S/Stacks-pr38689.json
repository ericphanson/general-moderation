It takes the `Stack` data structure introduced in [Transformers.jl](https://github.com/chengchingwen/Transformers.jl), and repackages it for standalone use.\r\n> * Documentation has been fully overhauled to provide a clearer introduction to the syntax of `@nntopo`'s `structure`.\r\n> * The explicit dependency on `Flux` has been removed for faster load, and more versatile use cases. Compatibility with Flux is now ensured through `Requires.jl`, with features such as parameter collection for `Stack` only being enabled once `Flux` is loaded.\r\n> * `Base.show` for both `NNTopo` and `Stack` has been reworked to better display the internal function composition, with `Stack` now fully showing the sequence of layers that will be called, and the inputs they will be called with.\r\n> * And of course, a new logo!\n<!-- END RELEASE NOTES -->\n\n<!-- bf0c69308befbd3ccf2cc956ac8a46712550b79fc9bfb5e4edf8f833f05f4c18b06eddad8845b45beb9f45c2b8020dd62c00552ce1ca9297804c6c1ce48d665ab9a8164aef1f0f5b73c16f56cd2a71adb5e2c0fb80313e52bd0018b09400accf74907eeb8ec129b04c43480d125db46baedb2a4fe3191982b8c6f96b89c476b32b84cf801ae79eedb4f562780afd4f6bc62b90f60c2c220f786d3e817eaea81846aab693dcc90038ac782ea7b0cb6ef3d9732b7b44e66d0ed12ff5b64ce3d910cf15da1fd97169415fd75e94093f84a4 -->",
