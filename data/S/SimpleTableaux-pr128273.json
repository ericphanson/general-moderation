      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "> Is there a typo in the package name? Shouldn’t it be `SimplexTableau`?\r\n\r\nGreat question! No, it's not a typo. Julia packages are often named by pluralizing their main objects. So the `Graphs` package defines `Graph` as the main data type. For this one, the main data type is `Tableau` and the proper plural is `Tableaux`. I added `Simple` because it's really a demonstration project for understanding how linear programs can be solved. It is not at all competitive with `HiGHS` or other optimization packages. ",

Is there a way I can cancel this attempted registration (or can you do it for me) and I'll resubmit under the new name?",
