I'm not sure having a package for each distribution is the way to go.\r\n\r\nI elected to submit a separate package since the Soliton distribution is quite niche. As far as I know it's only used for erasure correcting codes. I've opened an issue with Distributions.jl to ask for their opinion.\r\nhttps://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl/issues/1129",
