But this package eagerly loads all data in the directory into memory and saves everything all at once, so I think there should also be something like `Small` or `InMemory` or `Eager` in the name.",

      "body": "Both `SmallZarrGroups.jl` and `InMemoryZarr.jl` are totally fine from a general perspective. In general, having three words in a package name usually means that the name is unique enough not to raise any concerns. So pretty much any word you might want to add to or insert in `StorageTrees` would be fine.\r\n\r\nAlso: this is really just a suggestion. If you want to stick to `StorageTrees`, I can make my comments non-blocking ;-) ",
