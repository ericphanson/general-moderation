In particular, avoid acronyms unless there is minimal possibility of confusion.\r\n> It's ok to say USA if you're talking about the USA.\r\n> It's not ok to say PMA, even if you're talking about positive mental attitude.\r\n\r\nGuideline 4:\r\n> Err on the side of clarity, even if clarity seems long-winded to you.\r\n> RandomMatrices is a less ambiguous name than RndMat or RMT, even though the latter are shorter.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I do acknowledge that the guideline 6 says the following:\r\n> CPLEX.jl wraps the CPLEX library, which can be identified easily in a web search.\r\n> MATLAB.jl provides an interface to call the MATLAB engine from within Julia.\r\n\r\nBut I think that naming the Julia package after the library really only makes sense if the library is one of the first search results. For example, if you search for `CPLEX`, then the IBM web page for the CPLEX Optimizer is the first result. And if you search for `MATLAB`, then the Mathworks web page for MATLAB is the first result.\r\n\r\nBut if you search for `SDD`, then the C library doesn't show up in the first few pages.\r\n\r\nSo I think that guidelines 1 and 4 are important here.\r\n\r\nHow about one of the following:\r\n- `SententialDecisionDiagrams.jl`\r\n- `SDDiagrams.jl`",

Packages that wrap external libraries or programs should be named after those libraries or programs.\r\n\r\nIt does not really say anything about being easily identifiable in a web search, this is only mentioned in one of the examples.
