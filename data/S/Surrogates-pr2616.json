It's Surrogate models, surrogate sampling (AKA design strategies), and surrogate optimization. SurrogateModelsSamplingAndOptimization? That's why I just shortend it to Surragates: it's a package that tries to do everything you can ever think of with surrogates. If you can think of something people commonly do with surrogates that this package cannot do, that is a valid feature request.",
