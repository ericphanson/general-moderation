      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Repo URL does not end with /name.jl.git, where name is the package name\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: URIs\n- Package name similar to 7 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to SCIP. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 2.13 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to DFTK. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to FFTA. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to FFTW. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  5. Similar to HTTP. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  6. Similar to SDDP. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  7. Similar to STFT. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I see you've already renamed the package, but just for the record, I think a full-featured and well-maintained SFTP package could be granted an exception from the naming guidelines and go with the name `SFTP`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would put some scrutiny on a package with the name `SFTP` on how it is going to be maintained. Preferably, it would be managed within an organization, with multiple contributors, and with an expectation of continued funding / long-term maintainers. In general, with a very general package name, you wouldn't want to end up in a situation where the package ends up abandoned and unmaintained because the author left academia, or anything like that.",
