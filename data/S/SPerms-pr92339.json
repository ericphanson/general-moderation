This leaves SignedPerms as\nan available name. But if this comment is blocking I can change the name...\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJean MICHEL, Groupes et representations, IMJ-PRG UMR7586 tel.(33)157279144\nBureau 639 Bat.

      "body": "Abbreviations aren't a problem! The issue is with non-descriptive or ambiguous names. As you note, \"perm\" for \"permutation\" is pretty easily understood, with a little context. `SPerms` might just as well be `SortedPerms` or `SpecialPerms`, or many other things.\r\n\r\nThere's no claim of consistency across the ecosystem. Plenty of \"bad\" package names have slipped through, which should not be taken as an excuse for future package names. Moreover, opinions can differ on what makes a good package name. For example, I'm not quite as opposed to acronyms as some others. Even the official guidelines have evolved over time.\r\n\r\nDon't take these comments as a criticism: this is just community feedback to help you find a better package name. At least in my opinion, in most cases the package author should have the last word on naming. So, if you insist on the name, I would unblock my comment. But I think you're much better off renaming to `SignedPerms`: hopefully you agree that it's a significantly better package name.",
