      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Congratulations on the new package! However, I feel like the name `SimUtils` is much too general. This package has a very specific context and is not a collection of utilities for \"simulation\" in general. While `SimUtils` may be clear within the context of a particular organization (with maybe its own [local registry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl)), in the General registry, the package name would have to sufficiently descriptive for the wider audience of all Julia users.\r\n\r\nOne obvious way to provide context would for a \"Utils\" package would be to prefix it with the name of the package it is affiliated with, e.g., `SciBmadSimUtils` in this particular case.",
