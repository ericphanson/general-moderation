      "body": "Is this package actually meant for the general registry or is it some sort of test case @itsdebartha? I recall you mentioning on Slack that you were following Chris's package creation tutorial, so wondering whether this is part of a personal learning experiment in which case it probably shouldn't be in general.\r\n\r\nFWIW in addition to the standard GLM we also have https://github.com/st--/LinearRegression.jl which looks a lot like this package (at least once the to-dos about inference etc. are done). As duplication of efforts and ecosystem fragmentation is a recurring issue in the Julia community I would suggest you look at this package to see whether it might make sense to contribute there rather than registering another package with mostly overlapping functionality.",
