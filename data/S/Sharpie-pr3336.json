Was wondering about that and thought that maybe I'd get redirected to another registry better suited to packages that are on the humorous side. Glad you found it to be funny though. Feel free to close this PR. \r\n\r\n> Also, what do I do with this package? Just display the image in the readme?\r\n\r\nYes. I reckon that this is not a very general implementation yet... More seriously, I thought it might inspire someone to work on a package to hand annotate plots or detect falsified plots or something like that. But registering this was probably overkill. Feel free to close PR. \r\n\r\nThanks to you both for the great work you do btw",
