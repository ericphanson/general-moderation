Your \"Documentation: Passing\" badge currently gives a 404 error. This might fix itself automatically once the package is registered and there's a `stable` folder and automatic redirect, but please ensure that's the case.\r\n\r\nIt would be a good idea to include a paragraph in the README explaining the basic purpose of this package to someone who just randomly comes across it. \"A wrapper around NAIF's SPICE kernel solar system ephemeris platform!\" is a bit too short and only understandable to specialists already familiar with the field. You should add least add a link there to the platform you're wrapping, and summarize in a sentence or two what that platform does.\r\n\r\nI would also duplicate the usage example from the main page of your docs to the README.\r\n\r\n[SPICE.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/SPICE.jl#readme) seems to have a fairly decent README that I would emulate.\r\n\r\n> I think it's sufficient\r\n\r\nYour documentation is fine as a starting point, and definitely good enough for registration. In general, the bar for registration is whether someone can tell what the purpose of the package is and how to get started with it.\r\n\r\n> Do you need to add [noblock] to your comments to prevent blocking the merge?\r\n\r\nYes, I was blocking the merge because of the documentation issue. As soon as you expand the README a little bit and make sure there's a working link to the hosted documentation, I'll unblock so that the merge can go through.",
