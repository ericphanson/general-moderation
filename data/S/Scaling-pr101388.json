      "body": "Thanks for the suggestion! Unfortunately, the name FiniteSizeScaling is already taken. I think the name \"ScalingCollapse\" would also clarify the purpose of the package, what do you think?\r\n\r\nWhat's the smartest way to rename the package? Can I just rename:\r\n- the file Scaling.jl\r\n- the name field in the Project.toml\r\n- the module\r\n- the repository\r\nand after that tag the JuliaRegistrator again. Or is there anything else to consider?",
