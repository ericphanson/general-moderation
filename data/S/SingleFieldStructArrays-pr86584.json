      "body": "Seems like `mapview` function can be used instead of `SingleFieldStructArray` with exact same performance. It is even more general and shorter to type :)\r\nEg:\r\n```julia\r\n# either vanilla:\r\nmapview(x->x.t, foos)\r\n# or even, for convenience:\r\nmapview(:t, foos)\r\n\r\n# instead of\r\nSingleFieldStructArray(foos, Val{:t})\r\n```\r\nThe `mapview` function is available in either `SplitApplyCombine.jl` (older, more popular) or `FlexiMaps.jl` (newer, more focused and featureful).\r\n\r\nNot to discourage the package, especially in case if there are any non-trivial advantages of `SingleFieldStructArray`. At least I think these advantages (wrt `mapview` that has been around for a long time) should be highlighted in the readme.",

As you might have guessed, I was unaware of both `SplitApplyCombine.jl` and `FlexiMaps.jl`'s `mapview`. :-) `FlexiMaps.mapview` appears to do exactly what I want, and so I don't see any need to register this package.\r\n\r\n@jishnub Re: SingleFieldStructArrays.jl vs StructArrays.jl, my understanding is that they do opposite things. StructArrays.jl takes a struct of Arrays and makes it look like an Array of structs. SingleFieldStructArrays.jl takes an array of structs and makes it look like an array of one of the struct elements.",
