It seems like the package doesn't offer the intended functionality yet or at least it does not document how to use it. Maybe it's better not to register it under this name for now (you can always install packages from just GitHub). Instead, registering it under a different name like StructUtils.jl as suggested is not a bad idea. Later, if you create a package that truly provides programmatic means to work with structs and implement all your ideas from hackmd, you can always re-register it as Structs.jl, with StructUtils.jl as a dependency.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the package claims a valuable name but lacks documentation, use cases, or examples, and doesn't follow common conventions (e.g. it doesn't define `struct Struct ... end`). Additionally, if it's abandoned without implementing the intended functionality, the name would be lost forever. Also, is it already decided that this goes as a new module in Base?",

I understand there are conventions where a package Xs.jl provides a struct named X, but it doesn't seem like that has to be a hard and fast rule. I've added a bunch more documentation for the package, so hopefully that helps clarify for those who are wondering what the package may offer. The primary interface is `Structs.make`, which is extremely descriptive of what it does: make structs. Programmatically. Everything else in the package is additional support or utilities around making structs in various flows.\r\n\r\nAgain, I understand this is a bit of an aggressive name, but I also believe the package _does_ provide functionality that is centralized and core to structs in Julia, and very well could be a stdlib at some point. \r\n\r\nI'd like to request this be allowed to be merged.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

      "body": "From the README, it's still hard to understand how Structs.make helps more than Base.convert. I can easily write a custom methods for Base.convert for my structure to convert it from various sources. Does it generalize structure creation from DataFrames, JSON, or something else? For arbitrary JSON libraries? Or instead of writing custom `Base.convert` I would need to write custom `Structs.applyeach`? \n\nDon't get me wrong; I believe the library could be useful in certain situations. My opinion would also be that it should be registered. The discussion seems to focus on the name, which might be indeed too aggressive, misleading or confusing. Something along `MakeStructs.jl` or previously suggested are still not bad names. It actually may benefit you because just `Structs.jl` is too vague.\n\nThe package has many docstrings, which is great. However, centralized documentation (e.g., a docs folder) would make it easier to understand its applicability. There are no simple examples that demonstrate its applications. For instance, if it truly generalizes the creation of a structure from an arbitrary JSON, how do I use it?\n\nCurrently, the only way to discover how does the library work or how to use it is to install it and read numerous docstrings. But how do I determine where to start? which is the public API and which is not? Reading the source code? That's too difficult. This approach is unproductive and impossible when browsing for libraries on a phone where Julia can't be installed. (I actually did read the source code but quickly got lost, there is just too much methods that could (?) be defined, hard to get an idea where to start or what methods to define.) \n\nA few examples that make me think \"oh, that's cool, I need it\" would greatly benefit the library. E.g. making the structure from JSON (arbitrary library?) easier than just using Base.convert would already \"sell\" me the library.\n\nP.S. I double checked the documentation and you actually mention that this kind of documentation is forthcoming.\n\n[noblock]",
