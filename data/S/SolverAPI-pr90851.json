Our description indeed mentions Rel, but the package is not Rel-specific. It's our own JSON-based format for specifying optimization problems, similar to MOF from MathOpt. It can be used outside of the context of Rel and RelationalAI.\r\nWe'll change the description to reflect that!",

Since it is about interop with this SolverAPI format, rather than itself being an API for solvers. \r\n\r\nOr SolverAPIWriter or something? That would be similar to https://github.com/jump-dev/AmplNLWriter.jl, although here I think it is reading models from the format and writing solutions back to it.\r\n\r\n",
