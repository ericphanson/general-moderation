I'm assuming there's a reason you don't include the implementation of the MLJ interface in Soss.jl itself? \r\n\r\nAt present we do have interfaces that live outside the algorithm-providing package, but the convention for naming is different. For example, we have `MLJScikitLearnInterface` and will soon have others like `MLJMultivariateStatsInterface` (see the MLJModels \"disintegration\" [issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJModels.jl/issues/244#issuecomment-641668554)).  (I admit there is one exception to this rule `MLJFlux`.)",

That's why we decided to keep it in its own package.\r\n\r\nI don't feel too strongly about the name. We could also do `MLJSoss`.\r\n\r\n`MLJSossInterface` feels a little too verbose? But we could do that also.\r\n\r\nThe Soss+Gen integration is being worked on in https://github.com/cscherrer/SossGen.jl, so `SossMLJ` is consistent with `SossGen`.\r\n\r\n@cscherrer Any thoughts?",
