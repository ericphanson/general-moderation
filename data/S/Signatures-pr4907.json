Currently, I can think of two examples which user might think about what Signatures does:\r\n+ some processing with type signatures \r\n+ the electronic signatures from cryptography\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think the second option does dominate. Also, the library intends to cover the case of ring signatures which does not pop out in google easily when searches for electronic signatures. ",
