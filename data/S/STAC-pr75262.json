Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 7 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to SIAN. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  2. Similar to SEAL. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to STFT. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to FLAC. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  5. Similar to SHA.

Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "On popular demand (ok, somebody else and me :-) ), I am again attempting to register this package under the name STAC. The previous [attempt](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/59089) was not successful as that package name is too short. For reference these are the reasons I would like to use the name STAC:\r\n\r\nThe name STAC was chosen because the package implements the [STAC specification](https://stacspec.org/) where STAC stands for SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog. STAC.jl is similar to the python module [pySTAC](https://pypi.org/project/pystac/).\r\n\r\nThe standard specifies several types like (catalog, item, assets,...) which are available in Julia as `STAC.Catalog`, `STAC.Item`, `STAC.Asset` (the types `Catalog`, `Item` and `Asset` are not explicitly exported). A short module name is desirable in my opinion.\r\n\r\n(copied from https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/59089#issuecomment-1108567359 )\r\n\r\nIn addition, I think that the STAC protocol has a promising future because there are several earth observation data providers using it (and it is always referred as \"STAC\"), like:\r\n\r\n* [NASA Common Metadata Repository](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/ED/CMR+SpatioTemporal+Asset+Catalog+%28CMR-STAC%29+Documentation)\r\n* [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/)\r\n* [Microsoft Planetary Computer Catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/quickstarts/reading-stac/)\r\n\r\nDon't worry, this will be my last attempt to use register this package as STAC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
