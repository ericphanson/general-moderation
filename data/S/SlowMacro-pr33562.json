Some helpful feedback from others has convinced me that the name of this package should really be something like `ReferenceImplementation.jl`. I'm sorry for the hassle -- the next time this package hits the registry, I promise it won't have any further name changes.\r\n\r\nNomenclature can be tricky, and the scope of this package has changed significantly since its inception.",
