      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) which are not met ❌\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to SimpleArgParse. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1. Normalized visual distance 2.44 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n\n## 3. *Needs action*: here's what to do next\n\n1. Please try to update your package to conform to these guidelines. The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\n2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\n\nIf you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [public Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) for better visibility.\n\n## 4. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "> however @admercs in his mail which I cited above stated pretty clear his position - which is absolutely understandable, i.e. complete lack of spare time.\r\n\r\nA lack of spare time is definitely justification for not continuing the development of a package. I understand the realities of changing jobs, starting a family, or also just open-source burnout. Nobody owes anyone the indefinite continuation of an open-source project.\r\n\r\nHowever, Julia / the General registry is a bit unique in that we encourage nice, descriptive package names. I think that puts a responsibility on any maintainer registering in General to at least be available to hand the project over to a new maintainer if they can no longer continue maintenance. The more \"canonical\" the package name, the more important that there is a path towards a new maintainer. That's why I often push for very canonical names to be hosted by a GitHub organization with multiple owners.\r\n\r\nThere is precedent for the registry maintainers changing the URL for a registered package to point to a new, maintained fork. But this form of \"eminent domain\" is (and should be) an absolute last resort, for when the maintainer is completely unresponsive over a period of months. Basically, the \"got hit by a bus\" factor. It's much better if the original maintainer can be involved in the transfer and handover. But I do feel pretty strongly that  any package for which there is community interest should be under more or less active maintenance, and that we should avoid the `<PackageName>2` as a forking solution. (There are situations where `<PackageName>2` is the right thing to do, but those generally require the explicit consent of the `<PackageName>` maintainer)\r\n\r\n> I'd still wait for another week, then register the package under a sufficiently different name, e.g. YAArguParser.\r\n\r\nThat's fine, too, and probably the easiest solution.\r\n\r\nIt still leaves the problem that `SimpleArgParse` appears to be unmaintained, based on @admercs's email. I don't know how popular `SimpleArgParse` is in the wild, but if it could be considered one of the canonical arg-parsing solutions for Julia, that's something we should do something about, eventually.",
