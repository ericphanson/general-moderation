I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "[noblock] Yeah, just `SLH.jl` isn't going to be a possibility, but combining the \"acronym\" `SLH` with something that gives it context would be totally fine. It's up to you, though. But when I first saw just the name `SystemLevelHamiltonian` I definitely didn't make the connection, and just thought \"that's a weird name\". Of course, when I saw \"SLH\", I got pretty excited, since back in the day I worked on [QNET](https://github.com/mabuchilab/QNET) for a while… 😉\r\n\r\nThere _is_ some value in the recognizability of acronyms that gets lost when trying to write it out in a package name. But just `SLH` by itself doesn't mean anything to the broad audience of `General`, which is why we have a pretty hard \"minimum length 5 letters rule\" and a less hard \"no-all-caps rule\".",

      "body": "[noblock] SLH in Julia, love to see it! But I agree that system-level Hamiltonian is a confusing backronym, not least because an SLH triple doesn't generally describe unitary dynamics. If I stumbled over SystemLevelHamiltonian.jl while searching for a package for doing SLH algebra, I might just dismiss it and keep scrolling without taking a closer look. QuantumSLH.jl looks great to me, and also maximizes discoverability---I imagine the most likely search query for someone looking for a package like this would be \"SLH quantum julia\".",
