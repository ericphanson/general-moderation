The point is (1) to avoid abbreviations (`Spatial`, not `Spat`), and (2) to avoid the confusion of multiple packages existing with basically interchangeable names. `Rasters` and `SpatRaster`/`SpatialRasters` pretty much indicate the same scope, and the general sentiment is that it's better to only have one \"authoritative\" package covering a particular scope. So in general, if a new package has a different / more narrow scope than an existing package, the package name should be descriptive enough to clarify the difference. Alternatively, as the guidelines say \"A less systematic name may suit a package that implements one of several possible approaches to its domain\"\r\n\r\nThese obviously aren't hard rules, but we try to have some reasonable community consensus. In particular, the opinions of existing-package-authors would count a lot when a new package may impinge on the name/scope of their package. But they haven't taken the opportunity to voice any concerns, so I don't think it's my place to further block a registration.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
