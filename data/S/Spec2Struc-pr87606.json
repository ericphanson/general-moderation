I had no clue it was at all related to statistical mechanics. Would there be a way to make the package name more explicit?\nAt the moment my comment is blocking registration (anyone has the power to do that, I'm not a maintainer of the registry). If it's really important for you to keep the name, I'll make it nonblocking ☺️",

Why not use the full words then? `InverseStatisticalMechanics` or `Spectrum2Structure` also seem fine to me, and they are more in the spirit of the [package naming guidelines](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines).",
