      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Are you sure you want to tag this as `v1.0.0`? This seems like a `v0.1` version to me.\r\n\r\nIf you are following semantic versioning, then the `v1.0` release must define a stable API. Communicating what is and what is not part of that stable API requires full documentation, and detecting whether any change is breaking generally requires good test coverage.\r\n\r\nYour package only seems to export a single function, but even that isn't currently documented. You would probably also want to specify what kind of \"syntax\" in scripts is supported as part of your stable API (like the `<details>` you mention in the README).\r\n\r\nFor `v0.1`, the bar is much lower, and the current example is probably sufficient as a starting point for documentation. You should definitely mention `generate_report` in the README, though.",
