      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) which are not met ❌\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n\n## 3. *Needs action*: here's what to do next\n\n1. Please try to update your package to conform to these guidelines. The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\n2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\n\nIf you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [public Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) for better visibility.\n\n## 4. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

There seems to be less and less appetite for acronyms, though, so it may require repeated pings.\r\n\r\nBesides the pronounceability of `AMORS` (which makes it a perfectly acceptable [\"less systematic name\"](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-rules) in my book), good arguments might be that there is no very obvious alternative package name that would fit the usual \"long and descriptive\" mold, and that you could get around the automatic check by varying the spelling to `Amors` or `AMORs`. It seems silly to me to prevent the use of a package name solely based on capitalization.",

      "body": "> I could rename the package as Amors unfortunately it fails the AutoMerge distance test.\r\n\r\nI can override that check. Usually, it's a false positive. What package does `Amors` conflict with? I thought that the name similarity check was case-insensitive, so it's a bit surprising that `AMORS` doesn't trigger it as well.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I would make a strong case for `AMORS` being better than `Amors`. I dislike the idea of changing the capitalization of an acronym just to make the bot happy. By doing that, you lose the connection to what just _is_ an acronym. Personally, I think the choice between \"merge `AMORS` manually\" and \"let the renamed `Amors` auto-merge\" is a no-brainer, the former being hugely preferable to the latter from a community perspective.\r\n\r\n> I have checked that I can use `BilinearModelOptimalRescaling` which is a bit long but which conveys all necessary information\r\n\r\nThat's definitely an option that would side-step the issue. \"Long\" is generally encouraged, so that's not a problem. Plus, it's always possible to use it as `import BilinearModelOptimalRescaling as AMORS`. What you might lose is name recognition. I don't know how widely known the acronym AMORS is, and whether that's a significant concern.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation would be – unless you have a preference for `BilinearModelOptimalRescaling` – to wait to the end of the three-day period, and then ask for `AMORS` to be merged manually.\r\n\r\n> How do I cleanly cancel a registration?\r\n\r\nUnmerged registrations are automatically closed after 30 days of inactivity. Or, I can close a PR manually, which I usually do if there's a replacement, e.g., a new package name (\"Closing in favor of …\")\r\n\r\n",
