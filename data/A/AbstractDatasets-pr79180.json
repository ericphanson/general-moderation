      "body": "The NetCDF format is indeed widely used in geosciences, but is a container format like XML or JSON (but optimized for multidimensional arrays). NetCDF is closely related to HDF5 which has many applications beyond geosciences (e.g. in [keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load#hdf5_format)).  AbstractDatasets would be a collection of named multi-dimensional arrays with a list of metadata (like a Dict{String,Any}). AbstractDatasets would not require that the arrays are geo-referenced for example or that the arrays represent parameters related to the earth. There would not be a problem to store for example the MNIST dataset from Machine learning (a series of photos of  hand-written digits) in such an AbstractDatasets or a movie clip as a 4D array (color / x / y / time). Another example would be an audio file where the data arrays is the sound data and the metadata are the typical information, like artist and genre. \r\n\r\nInitially we focus on  NetCDF and GRIB data, but it would not be complicated to treat HDF5 files also as AbstractDatasets or other formats.",
