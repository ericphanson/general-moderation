      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 14 existing packages.\n  <details>\n  <summary>Similar package names</summary>\n\n  1.

However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Hello. I would like to register this package. It seems that the only issue is that the name is short (Air.jl) and additionally is similar to other packages with short names. I am okay with this and would like to register it anyway.\r\nSome context: Air stands for **A**tomic **I**mmutables **R**esource—it's a toolbox for using persistent (immutable) data structures and [STM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory) in Julia. The data structures are functionally similar to those in the old `FunctionalCollections` repository (which I believe is no longer maintained), but they have been rewritten from the ground-up. The STM resources in Air let you compose arbitrary thread-safe atomic operations on immutable data.\r\nAir is also a nice poetic name that captures something about the feel of the library that isn't particularly quantifiable—similar to libraries like [Avalon](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/tree/master/A/Avalon) and [Fire](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/tree/master/F/Fire).\r\nThanks!",
