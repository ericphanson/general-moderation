Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to ADTypes. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

      "body": "Compared to `convert`, the `as` method:\r\n1. provides type assertion which is useful if you consider the number of times expressions like `convert(T,x)::T` appear in Julia base code and many other Julia packages;\r\n2. has the ability to build a callable object for conversion, like `isequal` and a few other functions;\r\n3. can be extended to behave differently than `convert` for some specific types while perserving the semantic that it yields an object of the requested type and avoiding type-piracy. For instance the `CartesianIndex` constructor may be called to convert a tuple of integers to a Cartesian index but `convert(CartesiaIndex,x)` cannot do that.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, using `as` is mostly a matter of improving code readability for a common type of operation. I may be a bit paranoid on type-stability but making sure that parameters have a given stable type is something I do a lot, in particular for real-time applications. ",
