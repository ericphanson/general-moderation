This kind of slipped my attention...\r\n\r\nI added a description, README and the docs are now generated properly (although github pages seem to need some time to reflect that).\r\n\r\nThe package implements abstract data structures for the construction of neural networks and mainly serves as a common base package for [GeometricMachineLearning.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGNI/GeometricMachineLearning.jl) and [SymbolicNetworks.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGNI/SymbolicNetworks.jl).\r\n\r\nWe thought about calling it `AbstractNeuralNetworks` which is somewhat more descriptive, but also longer... however, if you think it would be better to change the name, we can do that.",

      "body": "Hey @michakraus, thanks for the answer!\r\n\r\nWhen I speak as a JuliaGraphs maintainer, AbstractNeuralNetworks.jl definitely sounds better because it prevents the graph theory interpretation.\r\nBut when I speak as a ML practitioner, AbstractNeuralNetworks.jl might also be too generic and people from the Lux, Flux or MLJ ecosystems would probably have something to say about that.\r\nIf I wanted to err on the side of caution, I would suggest AbstractNeuralNetworkUtils.jl, but that may be extreme. What do you think?\r\n\r\nSide note: in my field, whenever someone mentions geometric ML, the first thing that comes to mind is https://geometricdeeplearning.com/. I haven't checked out GeometricMachineLearning.jl, but is it related to this whole segment of the literature?",

I had a look around the Lux/SciML/MLJ repos and they all have their base packages, so naming clashes seem rather unlikely.\r\n\r\nGeometric Machine Learning refers to preserving geometric structure (Hamiltonian, Lagrangian, symmetries, invariance) by neural networks or using such structures to devise network architectures. It seems related to https://geometricdeeplearning.com/ but maybe not exactly the same.",
