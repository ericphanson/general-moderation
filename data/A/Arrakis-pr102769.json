      "body": "@goerz \"I can certainly live with \"Dune\" and \"Arrakis\" being registered under these names.\"\r\n\r\nNeither do I. I could though see Dune #102767 a good name for something else, but not Arrakis. Dune might be the go-to-name for this package, but I think all fans would know the latter. Since you don't have merging privileges (for Dune) consider just adding [noblock] here and then this name gets automatically added.\r\n\r\nI don't think obscure personal packages will go to \"infinite\", we can certainly add a policy if such get out of hand. An entry in registry is very cheap I think so just go for registering such until we have a problem, assuming the names aren't to useful for potentially other packages more deserving of the name.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
