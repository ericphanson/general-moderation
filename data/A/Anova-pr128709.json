      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) which are not met ❌\n\n- The registry consistency tests failed\n- Package name matches existing package name ANOVA up-to-case.\n\n## 3. *Needs action*: here's what to do next\n\n1. Please try to update your package to conform to these guidelines. The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\n2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\n\nIf you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [public Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) for better visibility.\n\n## 4. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I didn't look in any detail at whether the \"new\" package is conceptually consistent with the old package, but if it is, and if @marcpabst has no interest in the further development of `ANOVA`, one possibility would be to give @mwsohn commit access to the existing repo. Or, transfer the repo to @mwsohn as a new owner, or put it into a new or existing organization where both @marcpabst and @mwsohn have access. New development by @mwsohn could then eventually end up in a new `0.3` (or `1.0`) \"breaking\" release of the existing package.\r\n\r\nIf `ANOVA` is moved either to @mwsohn's account or to an organization, that would require updating the record in the General registry to point to the new location. That's something that's (somewhat) routinely done, though, so it shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nThe only alternative would be for @mwsohn to find a different, more distinctive name for the new package. `ANOVA` (or any other registered package) cannot be removed from the General registry and thus blocks the name.",
