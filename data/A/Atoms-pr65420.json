Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 5 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Atom. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1. Normalized visual distance 2.49 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to Atomix.

Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  5. Similar to Automa. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

For example, there are other packages with names like https://github.com/Chemellia/AtomicGraphNets.jl (@DhairyaLGandhi). I think that a slightly longer and more descriptive name is preferable here.",

      "body": "Thanks for the suggestion, @MasonProtter. For the moment, `Atoms.jl` provides a Hartree–Fock solver for the ground state of the atom, which indeed works with orbitals. In the future, however, I foresee adding capabilities going beyond the independent-particle model, e.g. a full two-electron wavefunction for helium, etc., where the concept of orbitals doesn't really apply. Hence, I would not want to lock-in on the orbitals aspect.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason (i.e. my future plans of extensions), I _do_ feel that the package will be general enough to warrant the name `Atoms.jl` (have you noticed I'm really fond of it? 😄), but I appreciate that other people may have differing ideas of what `Atoms.jl` would entail. How general do you think it should be @ViralBShah, for the name to be acceptable?\r\n\r\nI'm thinking of `AtomicSystems.jl` as an alternative, but I'm not completely happy about it, because it could be interpreted as systems made of atoms (molecules or crystals, I suppose, but those I would have named `Molecules.jl` and `Crystals.jl`, in the same vein), but for this package I am targeting the ground and excited states (in the future, I have code for this that needs clean-up) of single atoms, along with property calculations such as polarizability, perturbation theory, etc. Another name could be `AtomicStructure.jl`, but that is also a misnomer, since I do not consider the internal structure of the nucleus. `ElectronicStructure.jl` would be _correct_, but promising too much since again, I do not consider molecules or crystals.\r\n\r\nSoliciting some input from @antoine-levitt and @mortenpi.",

It can be pretty general. If some of the folks pinged here feel Atoms.jl is a way to go, I am also happy to merge it. I just wanted to get a small discussion going on a potentially more descriptive name.",
