      "body": "@timmyfaraday this package seems to do very little.  [`UnitfulCurrency.jl`](https://github.com/bhgomes/UnitfulCurrency.jl) looks more comprehensive as far currencies are concerned (but it's archived), and @rmsrosa has a more actively developed implementation in [`UnitfulCurrencies.jl`](https://github.com/rmsrosa/UnitfulCurrencies.jl).  I think it's better to join the forces instead of registering half-baked packages?  Or do you prefer to go on anyway with the registration of `AdditionalUnits.jl`?",
