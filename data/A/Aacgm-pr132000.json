      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I'm going to assume that you chose the capitalization of the package name `Aacgm` as opposed to the all-caps `AACGM` only because that will get past the automatic checks in the registration bot. While I understand the impulse of not wanting to have to ask for a manual merge, I believe that choosing names \"to make the bot happy\" is an extremely unfortunate outcome, from a community perspective. Unlike `AACGM`, the spelling `Aacgm` does not make it clear that the name is an acronym (even if one might guess from the abundance of consonants). I'd be much happier retaining that information. Maybe we can get a thumbs-up from one of the full registry maintainers on `AACGM`. If you get an okay, would you be willing to rename the package to the all-caps version?\r\n\r\nI would say that one very strong argument in favor of a manual merge of `AACGM` is that this registration would have gone though without complaint (nobody objected) under the name `Aacgm`, and `AACGM` is strictly a _better_ name.\r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n\r\n* As a 1-to-1 Julia implementation of an existing C library, this almost falls under the \"wrapper rule\" that Julia packages that wrap an existing project can retain that project's name\r\n* `AACGM`, while not pronounceable (I believe pronounceable acronyms are nearly always okay  as package names), is quite distinctive, and I'd have trouble coming up with an alternative name. The one possible alternative might be to combine the acronym `AACGM` with another word that gives context. Something like `GeoAACGM`. That is often my recommendation for packages that implement a very domain-specific method tied to a well-recognized (in that domain) acronym. Personally, I'd still be okay with just `AACGM` as a package name.\r\n\r\n",
