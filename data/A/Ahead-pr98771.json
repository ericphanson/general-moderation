Read carefully.     \r\n\r\n\"All the other tests\" are just the CI of the General registry (which this is a PR to), *not* the CI of your package. In short, all they tell us is that the General registry is not broken if `Ahead` is added to it. \r\n\r\nThe one check that is failing is automerge which as you rightly point out is checking whether the package can automatically be merged or needs human intervention. Here as discussed earlier the check failed due to name similarity, which is not an issue for this package so that it could be merged manually.\r\n\r\nHowever if you look into the failed action as @Seelengrab shows above what you'll see is that the check failed because the package can't be loaded, i.e. it is not currently working. This is also confirmed by your own CI, which is the relevant one here:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/assets/7264491/d366962a-aa25-429e-823b-1199e11668df)\r\n\r\nThis doesn't look like random failures, but rather consistent failures to do with an apparent issue with how the package is built. This should be fixed before a merge to General - all that the automerge action is doing here is checking that a package registered in General can actually be sucessfully installed, which is imho a low bar.\r\n\r\n",
