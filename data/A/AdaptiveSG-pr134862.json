      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

But it was already occupied when I came. The existing `AdaptiveSparseGrid.jl` by @jacobadenbaum is no longer maintained. The last commit was in 2022, 3 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe implementations of the existing `AdaptiveSparseGrid.jl` and `AdaptiveSG.jl` are different. The first one uses a recursive tree to represent the grid hierarchy. The second one, however, flattens everything to arrays. merging the two packages would almost rewrite everything. \r\n\r\nBut let's see how @jacobadenbaum thinks about this. I am glad to be a maintainer if such changes are acceptable to him. \r\n\r\nBest",

      "body": "I wouldn't quite say that `AdaptiveSparseGrids.jl` is \"unmaintained.\"  The maintenance status is: fixing bugs if people report them. I'm certainly not actively working on it, and haven't really looked at it for a while.  I'm open to moving the package or adding someone else as a maintainer if someone is interested in working on it.  I agree that it looks like the implementations are quite different under the hood, although as far as I can tell (from the README at least, haven't done a very deep dive here) the underlying functionality is quite similar.
