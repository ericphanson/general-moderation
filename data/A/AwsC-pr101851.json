Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to AWS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

      "body": "\"Short\" tends to be a quite problematic these days, and especially if you have to name a set of packages with a common prefix. We're getting pretty close to all the \"good\" short names being taken. So I would not make that a goal. In principle, AWS is also an acronym, so it would actually be better if it stays in caps. To avoid the \"too many caps\", I would consider a naming scheme like `AWSToolsIO`, `AWSToolsHTTP`, and then maybe `AWSToolsC` for this package.

Namely, I have a suite of packages I'd like to register, mirroring the aws-c-X set of C libraries (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/common-runtime.html). Doing AWSCommon, AWSIO, AWSHTTP, AWSS3 all feel excessively capitalized, so I think my preference is to do AwsC, AwsIO, AwsHTTP, AwsS3. These aren't meant to necessarily be widely used public packages, but more as building blocks for higher-level interfaces (like replacing the internals of HTTP w/ AwsHTTP).  ",

      "body": "> Doing AWSCommon, AWSIO, AWSHTTP, AWSS3 all feel excessively capitalized, so I think my preference is to do AwsC, AwsIO, AwsHTTP, AwsS3.\r\n\r\nI think it is not clear, especially for `AwsS3`, that these package names refer to generated C bindings and a little filler, and not something higher level. I'd want to adopt a naming scheme like `AwsCrt*` e.g. `AwsCrtS3`, `AwsCrtIO`, etc. Also I agree with the `AwsCrt*` scheme instead of the `AwsC*` scheme because some of the CRT packages do not have `-c-` in their names, e.g. `aws-lc` which could be registered as `AwsCrtLC`.\r\n\r\nThis package also mixes high and low level functionality. Some decisions are made for the user, [like in this init function](https://github.com/JuliaServices/AwsC.jl/blob/698120bc9bf44afad222be740e26b050676ba240/src/LibAwsC.jl#L116-L130), which makes these packages less composable. For example, my AWSCRT work would not compose well with this package. It would be better if you registered the generated bindings as separate `LibAwsCrt*` packages (containing only bindings).",
