      "body": "> Please add julia compat.\r\n\r\nI've added `[compat] julia = 1` to `master`. I tried re-typing `@JuliaRegistrator register()`, but it's now saying `An unexpected error occured during registration.` (https://github.com/NHDaly/ApplicationBuilderAppUtils.jl/issues/1#issuecomment-487590872)\r\n\r\nAny idea what i'm supposed to do differently? Or is the Registrator just temporarily down?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Also, kinda weird with the word \"App\" twice in the package name :)\r\n\r\nHaha yeah I know... I agree with you, but don't have any better ideas.\r\n\r\nIt's cause these are utilities _for the apps_ being built with ApplicationBuilder. That is, users are encouraged to add a dependency to this package if they want to get runtime OS information from inside their app. Before, I was injecting this functionality into the program being compiled, but it was very flaky.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to name it `ApplicationBuilderUtils`, because it's not utilities _for building Apps_, it's utilities to be accessed _from the apps themselves_. But they'll only work if you used `ApplicationBuilder` to build your app. Do you have any other good suggestions? :) I'd appreciate some help. :)\r\n\r\n",
