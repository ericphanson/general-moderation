Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to MDTable. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

I don't think there's any implication that it has to match the AG Grid API exactly. Actually, if it was a full wrapper around that API, `AGGrid` could be an appropriate name (potential trademark issues notwithstanding).\r\n\r\nThere is no way in which `AgTable` communicates \"This is about AG Grid Tables, but only a subset of the API\". Apart from that, `AG` should definitely be capitalized. `AgTable` would be misleading: I would assume the package to be related to chemistry (silver table).",

      "body": "Yeah, but \"AG Grid\" is a proper noun, and is pretty integral to the context of this library. You really want that to be part of the name, or you would completely lose that connection. Nobody will make an association from just \"AG\" to \"AG Grid\". If this library is (or may become) a reasonably complete wrapper around \"AG Grid\", then `AGGrid`/`AgGrid` should be okay. I don't know about the trademark issue. My recommendation would be to check in with someone from the AG Grid company. Other than that, any kind of legal issues would be for you to determine. I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding is that you can \"fair use\" trademarks if you're actually referring to the trademarked product. Whether that extends to using the name verbatim, I don't know.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to replace `Table` with some other word that might be a better fit, that's totally fine, too. But definitely keep `AGGrid`/`AgGrid` in there.",
