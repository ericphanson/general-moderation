Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 2 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to AuthGG. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  2. Similar to Automa. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Just a few examples include POMDPs.jl, POMDPGifs.jl, GLM.jl, ANOVA.jl, ARFIMA.jl, AnovaGLM.jl, QuasiGLM.jl, TuringGLM.jl, AdaOPS.jl, ACTRModels.jl, BEAST.jl, BaytesSMC.jl, BaytesMCMC.jl, BaytestPMCMC.jl, PANDA.jl, SMC.jl, GARCH.jl GLMNet.jl, ODE.jl.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
