      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "From the README:\r\n\r\n> A detailed description of the supported methods will be added at a later point in time.\r\n\r\nIf you are following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), that would be at odds with an initial version number >= 1.0. As a general rule, versions `<v1.0` are for initial development, when the API of the package isn't nailed down yet, the package does not have a lot of dependents, and \"backwards compatibility\" is not a major concern. For an initial registration, that's usually the situation your package is in. Thus, an initial `v0.1` is usually the way to go. The bar for registering an initial `v0.1` is not very high. Basically, just\r\n\r\n* Must have a name that is appropriate for the scope of the package\r\n* Must have some non-trivial functionality (no \"placeholder\" packages)\r\n* Must have a README that explains the purpose of the package and gives a basic usage example (or a link to documentation that is sufficient to figure out how to get started)\r\n\r\nFor a version `v1.0`, you're saying that the package already has a stable API. That has some implications for what one would expect from that package. Personally, I tend to apply the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n* Must _define_ the stable API. That generally means _complete_ documentation.\r\n* Should have tests with reasonable coverage (on the order of 80%). Otherwise, there's no way to know if the package actually implements its API correctly, and no basis for figuring out whether a pull request is \"breaking\" or not, going forward.\r\n* Should somewhat reasonably fill the described scope of the package. No _major_ gaps in functionality.\r\n\r\nEven if you think your package is fairly polished already, I always recommend registering with an initial `v0.1` anyway. That way, you have a chance to find out whether there are any major flaws in the package once people start to use it. Once it has a few dependents and you really should start to worry about maintaining backwards compatibility, you can always make a `v1.0` release. That doesn't mean you absolutely have to make significant changes to the `v0.1` version. Just make sure that your package is fully documented as \"stable\" at that point, has good test coverage, and all the other things people would expect from a \"stable\" package.\r\n\r\nUltimately this is your decision. If you want to lower the version number, you can just do another registration. You can also add a full API documentation while the registration is still pending, and then just retrigger the [`v1.0.0` registration](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/130936) or the `v1.0.1` registration here.\r\n\r\nRetriggering a registration to fix issues found while the registration is pending normal; you should generally not _change_ the version number to, e.g., `v1.0.2` while a registration is pending (unless the version number is inappropriate, of course). Retriggering while keeping the version number the same updates and existing PR, changing the version number creates a new PR.\r\n",
