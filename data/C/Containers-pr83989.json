This is the reason for such a \"generic\" name. Anyway, I was already thinking about the fact that such a name could be used within the `Base` or `Core` packages for something else, but there there where no guidelines on that, so I open the request with `Containers`! :)\r\n\r\nThe point here is actually to have a method to iterate a user-defined `Tuple` without any allocation not exploiting the _function barrier_ approach as it leads to poor performances w.r.t. the proposed one. The \"containers\" are actually built on top of `NamedTuples`, and shortly I'll push a major update with all the _zero-allocating_ interfaces/methods for the iteration over this type.  \r\n\r\n[noblock]\r\n",
