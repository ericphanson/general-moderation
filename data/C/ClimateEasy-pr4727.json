Under the `Some checks were not successful` heading, in the `Travis CI - Pull Request` row, click on the `Details` link.\r\n2. Scroll all the way to the bottom and click on `View more details on Travis CI`.\r\n3. Click on the `Julia: 1.2` job.\r\n4. Read the Travis logs. You may need to click the ▶ triangle in the left hand column in order to show hidden rows.\r\n\r\nFor example, in this case, look at the Travis logs starting at line 363.
