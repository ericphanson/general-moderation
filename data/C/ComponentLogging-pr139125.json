I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Thank you for submitting your package! Could you add a little bit of documentation before registering? [At the very least](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/when-does-it-make-sense-to-post-a-new-package-to-the-julia-repository/108701/4), that would be a description of the package's purpose and a small usage example in the README. An important part of packages in General is that any potential user can figure out what the package is about and how to get started with using it. That is really difficult when there is no documentation.\r\n\r\nIn general, I definitely recommend setting up a [Documenter](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/)-based documentation. In your case, you already have the documentation badges in the README, but these currently aren't working, as your documentation builds are failing in CI. I think you might be able to fix that failure by adding a [`[sources]` section](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/toml-files/#The-%5Bsources%5D-section) to [`docs/Project.toml`](https://github.com/abcdvvvv/ComponentLogging.jl/blob/master/docs/Project.toml):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[sources]\r\nComponentLogging = {path = \"..\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis requires using at Julia 1.11 to build the documentation, so you should [change that in your `.github/workflows/Docs.yml` file](https://github.com/abcdvvvv/ComponentLogging.jl/blob/cc37c8846ff6fea715cd9f53e4f99010f9c6492e/.github/workflows/Docs.yml#L18) (probably best to just set it to `'1'`).\r\n\r\nLastly: Could this package be hosted under the [JuliaLogging organization](https://github.com/JuliaLogging)? By putting packages in a well-established organization with multiple owners, it avoids the possibility of becoming permanently unmaintained.",

My recommendation would be to resolve the same documentation issues I already raised with respect to the registration in general:\r\n\r\n* In the README, explain what problem the package solves and how it fits in with other existing packages in the JuliaLogging org\r\n* Make sure that there is sufficient API documentation\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

In particular, it's not immediately obvious right now what the symbols and integers in the `rules` dict mean, right now.
