I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Hello - it is based on Carnot type cycles for example Organic Rankine cycle and Vapor Compression Cycles.\r\nHence the name CarnotCycles.jl\r\nI don't have other \"nice\" names. If there are any suggestions please feel free. \r\n\r\nedit: It should be able to model the generic Carnot Cycle as well. All the necessary process and components are there. But your point that ORC is not exactly Carnot Cycle is also valid.\r\n\r\nedit 2: After thinking about your point - I'll put an example of the generic Carnot Cycle in example. Maybe that should suffice and justify the name? \r\n",
