  "body": "- Registering package: CMPlot\n- Repository: https://github.com/g-insana/CMPlot.jl\n- Created by: @g-insana\n- Version: v0.9.0\n- Commit: 5b2556cbecd9ffc58ea0bdcd4fb838d7eec29d5d\n- Git reference: master\n- Release notes:\n<!-- BEGIN RELEASE NOTES -->\n> CMPlot.jl - Cloudy Mountain Plot in Julia\n> \n> An informative RDI categorical distribution plot inspired by Violin, Bean and Pirate Plots.\n> \n> (RDI = Raw data + Descriptive statistics + Inferential statistics)\n> \n>     Like Violin plots, it shows smoothed kernel density curves, revealing information which would be hidden in boxplots, for example presence of multiple \"peaks\" (\"modes\") in the distribution \"mountain\".\n> \n>     Like Bean plots, it shows the raw data, drawn as a cloud of points. By default all data points are shown but you can optionally control this and limit the display to a subset of the data.\n> \n>     Like Pirate plots, it marks confidence intervals (either from Student's T or as Bayesian Highest Density Intervals or as interquantile ranges) for the probable position of the true population mean.\n> \n> Since by default it does not symmetrically mirror the density curves, it allows immediate comparisions of distributions side-by-side.\n<!-- END RELEASE NOTES -->",
