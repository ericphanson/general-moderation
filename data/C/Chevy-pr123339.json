      "body": "[noblock] Yeah, `Chevie` is the only one that’s a bit close for comfort. Generally, the point of the similarity check is to prevent malicious typo-squatting, which this is not. Otherwise, we only strictly apply the rule for names that differ by the plural-s. So, I’m going to tentatively apply the override. I would give @jmichel7 the chance to weigh in, though, an how confusing the name similarity might be for `Chevie` users.\r\n\r\nAn obvious alternative would be `Chevron`, of course, although that might carry unwanted association with the corporation. As a language-nitpick: I’m not sure `>` is considered a “chevron”. I think that word only describes wedges pointing up or down. Make of that what you will (I’m not “objecting” to the name) 😉",
