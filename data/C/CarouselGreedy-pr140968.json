      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

The release after 0.1.0 just merged in https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/139137 has be 0.1.1.\r\n\r\nFor future reference, you cannot make additional releases while an original registration is pending. You also should never tag releases manually. A tag should be created _after_ the release has been registered in the General registry. The usual (and strongly recommended way) to do that is automatically via [TagBot](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/TagBot#setup).\r\n\r\nHere's what you should do now:\r\n\r\n- [ ] check that the [`v0.1.0` tag](https://github.com/RaffaeleDragone/CarouselGreedy.jl/releases/tag/v0.1.0) in your repo actually matches the commit that was merged in https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/139137. If not, delete and recreate on the correct commit\r\n- [ ] Delete all other tags in https://github.com/RaffaeleDragone/CarouselGreedy.jl/tags\r\n- [ ] Set up TagBot\r\n- [ ] Prepare a `v0.1.1` release and register it",
