      "body": "IMHO, if we use a full name, it seems to be the best and only package, but I want to leave some space for other packages that may appear in the future.\r\nAlso, personally, I don't like long names for packages. Using them isn't the problem, but extending the interface or developing new functionality based on the interface requires having full qualified functions that result to import the package by the actual name. Or use a `as` clause that makes reading codes inconsistent because someone may use `import ContinuousNormalizingFlows as ContinuousNF` and another one use  `import ContinuousNormalizingFlows as CNF`.\r\nHowever, if there's any strong points to have a long name; I'm willing to change the name.",
