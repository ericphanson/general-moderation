      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- The compat entry for `julia` is unbounded.\n- Package name similar to 8 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to CBOR. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1. Normalized visual distance 1.39 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to COBS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 2.02 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  3. Similar to CAOS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 2.44 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  4. Similar to CBLS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.

Normalized visual distance 2.04 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  7. Similar to CUDD. Normalized visual distance 2.04 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  8. Similar to ODBC. Normalized visual distance 2.30 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Thanks for reaching out. I think it's best to stay with `CBOOCall.jl` . Maybe we can change it later if it seems appropriate. I don't think it will have as many users as `LightGraphs` soon. I actually originally called the (at the time only) macro in the package `@cboo_call`.  I already pointed out in the README (when it was still `CBOO.jl`) that name is too broad. All the package does is let you use the standard method call syntax. So `CBOOCall.jl` is probably more descriptive. The disclaimer is still there, and now I have to remove it because the name actually fits better.\r\n\r\nI really like `CBOO.jl` because it's punchy and short. But, I think it's better to be disciplined with the name.\r\n\r\n",
