      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Personally, I would consider the comment in the README\r\n\r\n> A detailed documentation is planned to be available soon.\r\n\r\nto be at odds with registering as a `v1.0.0` version. If you are following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), a `v1.0` promises a stable API, which must be well-specified so that you can track breaking and non-breaking changes, going forward.\r\n\r\nYour intuition to start with `v1.0.0-dev` in https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/127447 was probably a good one. In my opinion, it would be totally fine to tag `v0.1` when making a package public that's on it's way to being stable, as \"pre-1.0\". That then allows you to refine the API after people have had a chance to actually use it, and to further work on the documentation. Then, you can directly tag `v1.0` in the near future. There's no requirement that a `v1.0` version somehow has to be \"breaking\" with respect to the last `v0.x` release; it's fine to use the `v1.0` label to designate the package as \"stable\" (at least in my opinion).\r\n\r\nSo, I would recommend either adding full documentation (and, ideally, also tests with coverage) before continuing with the v1.0 registration, or changing the version number to something pre-1.0. But it's up to you. The README is already in pretty good shape, so I can unblock if you want to keep going with v1.0.",
