It is a package to be used on its own. Thus, changing the name does not have any disadvantages.\r\n- I had an idea for creating a bot for PackageCompiler. Now, that the repository is no longer a sub-directory of SnoopCompile, I can extend its purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not just change the name without providing deprecation messages, so those who use the old version will be informed about this change: \r\nhttps://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl/pull/140\r\n\r\n\r\n",
