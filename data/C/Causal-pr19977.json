      "body": "Actually, this pull request was created to rename an existing package Jusdl.jl to Causal.jl. The last version of Jusdl.jl  was v0.2.2 so I wanted to register the new package Causal.jl with version v0.2.3 #19976. This did not meet the auto merging guidelines as version number was not 0.0.1, 0.1.0, 1.0.0, or X.0.0. So, I changed the version of Causal to v1.0.0. But now I want to register Causal with the version number v0.3.0. Is this possible?",
