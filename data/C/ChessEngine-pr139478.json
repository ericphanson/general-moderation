I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Thank you for submitting how package! Unfortunately, the name `ChessEngine` strikes me as too general. Chess engines famously exists in many flavors, and may be the prototypical case for something where a \"less systematic name\" (in the [naming guidelines](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines)) is the most appropriate.\r\n\r\nFor a package to be named `ChessEngine`, it would not just have to be \"_a_ Julia chess engine\", but \"_the_ Julia chess engine\"... or a meta-package that wraps around multiple chess engines.\r\n\r\nCertainly `<Name>ChessEngine` would be an appropriate package name, though.\r\n\r\nAll this being said, the package looks very nice and on a good path to maturity, so I hope you can re-register with a less general name",
