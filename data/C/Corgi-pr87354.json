Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 2 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Korg. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  2. Similar to Norg. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

I'm not sure this package is ready to be registered yet, maybe add a few more things to it beforehand? See the [guidelines](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General#should-i-register-my-package-now) here.\r\n\r\n> I can't release package because of its name is to similar to packages Norg and Korg?\r\n\r\nExactly, that is expected behavior. Most Julia package registrations are automatic, and to prevent namespace pollution or accidental installation of wrong packages, a minimum distance between names is enforced. If this minimum distance check fails, a human has to merge the PR.\r\n\r\nI personally don't have merge rights, I just happen to be invested in the Julia ML community, and so I took the liberty to ask for details :)",
