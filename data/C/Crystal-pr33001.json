I'm relaively new to Julia and did not expect a human to actually see this. Admire your dedication! I've been working on usage instructions and would just re-submit the merge request via the JuliaHub? I hope this is how this works?\r\n\r\nRegarding the name. I'd like to keep Crystal.jl if at all possible, since the point of the Package is to create atomic arrangements with crystalline structure.",

I'd like to keep Crystal.jl if at all possible, since the point of the Package is to create atomic arrangements with crystalline structure.\r\n\r\nHowever, as you stated in the README: \"This package contains functionality to create body centered cubic and face centered cubic crystal, both of which are very common structures in metals\". It seems this package only deals with BCC and FCC which is a very small subset of crystalline structures. I would strongly recommend you to rename this package to a more specific name such as CreateCubicCrystal.jl or CubicCrystal if you can provide the full functionalities of dealing with all space groups for cubic crystal system.\r\n@dpsanders @eschmidt42\r\n",
