      "body": "[noblock] I want to add a note about the name of this package, in case anyone raises an objection (or has feedback relating to it). This is the same as my package CIFTI.jl, but that package has been held up in a naming conflict and I haven't been able to make the case that CIFTI.jl is the right naming choice. My next choice in naming is Cifti2, which is the name of the present package. The \"2\" refers to version 2 of the [CIFTI specification](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cifti/) that it supports -- which is in fact more accurate, though it's not a distinction people usually make or are aware of. As for the capitalization, technically it should be all caps but in practice people usually write it lowercase so I think the capatalization as it stands now is fine.",

Having an all caps package name is not unusual when it's a file reader (e.g. `CSV.jl`, `JSON.jl`...) so I don't think there's an issue here.",

HDF5.jl is one example).\r\n\r\nIf this isn't a good argument against, then there's the other about preferring upper case. CIFTI2.jl would be another option.\r\n\r\nYour package will become 10,000 if @nilshg unblocks here, or if you unblock the upper case PR. Unless someone beats you to unblocking their packages from the queue...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
