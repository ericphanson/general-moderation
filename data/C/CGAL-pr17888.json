      "body": "[noblock] I probably should create a package announcement on discourse, but I'll take the time to talk about it a bit here.\r\n\r\nFirst off, hello everyone!\r\n\r\nI've been hammering away for quite a while now mapping [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org) types, functions, and algorithms to julia for my sake. Henceforth, I'd like to make it easily available for anyone and everyone who would be interested in using it.\r\n\r\nIt currently makes available most, if not all, kernel objects, a few packages, albeit not entirely mapped due to some technical limitations, along with intellectual ones (I'm not that smart of a cookie). Documentation is relatively lacking, only having some reference docs available. Future work, I suppose.\r\n\r\nPart of making it widely available also consequently allows me to use it as a dependency without creating an entire separate registry, cutting that extra overhead off.\r\n\r\n**Addendum**: About the package name: I don't see any other name that would properly fit the package.. Unless I run into trouble for using that name.",
