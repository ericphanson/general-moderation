Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to Classes. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

      "body": "Dear Julia package developers,\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose the new package `Clausen.jl` to be merged into julia's package registry. The package calculates the Clausen function (known from mathematics), used in many specialized areas of physics.\r\n\r\nHowever, the auto-merge fails with a hint that the package name `Clausen` is close to an existing package named `Classes`.\r\n\r\nI understand that the names `Clausen` and `Classes` look similar for a machine. However, for a human, semantically these two names have absolutely nothing in common. :) **Thomas Clausen** is the name of a Mathematican. On the other hand, **Classes** is an abstract concept from computer science. Both are completely different terms and will thus not be confused by a human. :)\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I'd ask you to manually merge this PR.\r\n\r\nWith best regards\r\nAlexander Voigt\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
