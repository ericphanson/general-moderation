      "body": "This is only barely less empty than the previous registration at https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/108582. Please don't try to register this package again until it is a little bit more mature. See [Should I register my package now?](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#should-i-register-my-package-now):\r\n\r\n> If your package is at a stage where it might be useful to others, or provide functionality other packages in General might want to rely on\r\n\r\nI don't think this is yet at a stage where others can use it in any meaningful way. There should be more functionality, and - very importantly - there has to be some form of documentation. [At the very least](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/when-does-it-make-sense-to-post-a-new-package-to-the-julia-repository/108701/4), that would be a description of the package's purpose and a small usage example in the README.\r\n\r\nNote that package registration isn't really necessary until there are other registered packages that should use this package as a dependency. I realize that \"unregistered\" packages make some development workflows more difficult. For that, I would recommend that you look at [LocalRegistry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl). Setting up your own development registry also takes care of any issues you might have with this package being a dependency of other *unregistered* packages or projects.\r\n",
