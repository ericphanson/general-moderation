This package only retrieves data via a rest api.\r\n\r\nOkay, things can go wrong in simple cases too, but it doesn't matter, just something I noticed.\r\n\r\n> And the OData3 interface will be replaced with OData4 in the next 1 or 2 years.\r\n\r\nOkay, perhaps the packaeg name should not include the version number then? Perhaps `CBSOData` is a good name and when the new format is released you can just update the implementation instead of creating a new package.\r\n\r\nAnyway, these are just suggestions, ultimately it is up to you.",
