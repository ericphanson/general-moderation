Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Repo URL does not end with /name.jl.git, where name is the package name\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to Polymer. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1. Normalized visual distance 2.38 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

Please consider:\r\n\r\n1) The package will provide Julia API to a Rust library, and should be located in the same repository. There is also Python API in the repository, and a bunch of packaging. It would be weird for only the Julia interface to have its own repository, and complicate things (it's best to test all implementations together to eliminate bugs -> build/test Julia and Python API right alongside the Rust library for optimal CI/CD).\r\n\r\n2) The name Polymers is _heavily_ standardized across the different areas of this project (GitHub, Cargo, Crates.io, PyPI, Conda, Docker, ReadTheDocs, Binder, Discord, and more soon) and it would be really weird for _only_ the Julia package to have a different namespace. Further, the fact that this will come from a more unique URL should actually alleviate the potential misnaming concern.",
