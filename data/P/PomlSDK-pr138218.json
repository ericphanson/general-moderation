You can archive it, or rename it, using the GitHub user interface.\r\n\r\n> the package was not accepted because of naming conflict with MLUtils.jl .\r\n\r\nThat was a false positive. In fact, the registration _was_ merged: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/138169. I probably should have added a comment when overriding the name similarity issue to make sure you are notified.\r\n\r\nFor now, I think the easiest way to deal with this is to revert https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/138169.\r\n\r\n> the UUID for POMLSDK.jl was generated normally( I use PkgTemplates.jl)\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: The original `POMLUtils` and the new `PomlSDK` have the same purpose, and the same code (up to modifications from the last three weeks). Is that correct? That is, conceptually `PomlSDK` is a _rename_ of `POMLUtils`?\r\n\r\nWhile we're sorting this out, I wonder if we can revisit the package name. I'm not super enthusiastic about `PomlSDK`: `POML` is still an acronym, and I think it should be in all-caps when used as part of a package name. That would be `POMLSDK`, which would violate the not-all-caps-rule. `SDK` is also a somewhat meaningless suffix. I actually think that the original `POMLUtils` was a _better_ name, even though `Utils` is also one of those less-than-descriptive suffixes. Maybe there's something more descriptive (but I haven't had any good ideas). If nobody comes up with something good, `POMLUtils` is still something we can go back to... but even then, we should probably revert https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/138169 first, since you probably can't guarantee that you can still reproduce the tree-hash of the original release, having deleted the repo. In that case, generate a completely new UUID, just for good measure.",

A registry maintainer would then close the registration process of the old package and validate the new one . I just delete the repository after because it is useless after merging the package to the registry. I guess this time I just didn't get notified that the original name was accepted (\"POMLUtils.jl\") and that caused this issue.\r\nFinally,  I thank all the Registry maintainers for the feedback and help .

      "body": "> I had naming conflicts before […]\r\n\r\nFor future reference, the automatic \"name similarity check\" is probably 90% false positives. It is also easy to override. So generally, wait and see if there's some other response about a naming conflict, before actually going ahead and renaming the repository.\r\n\r\n> […] and it was solved using the same approch: I just create a new package with same code (different UUID) and a valid name and retrigger Registrator \r\n\r\nI would not recommend that approach. Instead, see the [FAQ entry for \"What to do when asked to reconsider/update the package name?\"](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#what-to-do-when-asked-to-reconsiderupdate-the-package-name). Most importantly, use the GitHub UI to _rename_ the repository. This will then forward all URLs from the old project to the new project.\r\n\r\nYou also (usually) don't really need a new UUID. In this case, it seems like you actually kept the UUID and triggered the \"problem\", but the \"problem\" was only that the package was already registered as `POMLUtils`. \r\n\r\n> I should not delete repos in the future until the merging is done\r\n\r\nGenerally, don't delete repos at all after they've been \"in public\" in any significant way… including having been used for a registration.\r\n\r\nAnyway. So now that https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/139294 is merged, _in principle_ this PR could probably be unblocked and merged.\r\n\r\nStill, my recommendation would be to go back to `POMLUtils` (or an even better name, if you or someone else can think of one), using the [FAQ instructions](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#what-to-do-when-asked-to-reconsiderupdate-the-package-name).\r\n\r\nDoes all of this make sense?
