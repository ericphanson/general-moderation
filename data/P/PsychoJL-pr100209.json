      "body": "I disagree. I think that\r\n\r\n> PsychoJL is a module for writing psychology and psychophysics experiments. The general framework and style is inspired by PsychoPy, but there has been no collaboration with the authors of PsychoPy.\r\n\r\nDoes not warrant including JL in the name PsychoJL.jl. Julia and Python have different package naming conventions. Most notably in this case, all Julia names are already suffixed by .jl. \r\n\r\nGiven the description of the repo is\r\n\r\n> API for writing Psychology Experiments\r\n\r\nI would recommend the name PsychologyExperiments.jl because that way anyone who sees the package name immediately knows that it is a Julia package for physiology experiments (whereas, for example, if it is named PsychoJL.jl, someone seeing the name wouldn't know if it is for experiments or if it is targeted at modeling psychological states directly, at embedding human psychology in AI, or supporting academic instruction in psychology, etc.). To get a more accurate picture one would still need to read the manual, but it's nice to give folks as much as possible to wrkr off of at a glance.\r\n\r\nIff psychophysics is central to the package and is not a type of psychology, then it would imo make sense to abbreviate to PsychoExperiments.jl.",
