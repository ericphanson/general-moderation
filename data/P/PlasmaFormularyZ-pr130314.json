If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3.

      "body": "_In principle_, this should be okay. But, the original repo is already part of the [JuliaPlasma](https://github.com/JuliaPlasma) organization, and the whole _point_ of organizations is to avoid issues like this. Moving a project from an organization to a personal account is extremely non-ideal. Who are the owners of the organization? @adamslc @michakraus\r\n\r\nAn org owner should be able to give you admin rights over the old repo so that you can register that instead. If all the org owners are unreachable, that would be a _big_ problem, from a community perspective. But let's exhaust all options before figuring out what to do with a situation like that.",
