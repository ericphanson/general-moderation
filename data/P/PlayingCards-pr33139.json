      "body": "I'd be happy to try to merge these two packages, but I do have a few downstream packages ([HoldemHandEvaluator.jl](https://github.com/charleskawczynski/HoldemHandEvaluator.jl) and [NoLimitHoldem.jl](https://github.com/charleskawczynski/NoLimitHoldem.jl)) which depend on `HoldemCards.jl`. The problem with merging that I see is that the evaluator package currently leverages the suit types, and using Symbols may require work-arounds that I'd prefer to avoid (e.g., using defining methods with `::Val{:Hearts}`). There's also [Cards.jl](https://github.com/StefanKarpinski/Cards.jl) (unregistered), but that also doesn't use types for suits.\r\n\r\nI'm not in a hurry to register `HoldemCards.jl`, so I'd be fine taking some time to discuss further.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

Any sense?\r\n\r\nYeah, it seems like the last commit was quite a while ago.\r\n\r\n> but the name HoldemCards??? What if I want to play Hearts :-)?\r\n\r\nHaha yeah, I'm not married to the name-- I just wanted to distinguish from `Cards.jl` since I don't need Jokers (and I need types for suits). But I don't think it would be a problem to include Jokers to make the package more general and add different deck constructors for different games (`deck(Holdem()), deck(Hearts())` etc.).\r\n\r\nI do like the name `PlayingCards.jl`. I'd be happy to change the name of HoldemCards.jl to PlayingCards.jl and adding some functionality for supporting other card games if you'd be interested in switching over. There are a few things in PlayingCards.jl which I think might need to be moved to a separate package (specifically related to ordering / evaluation) and some things that can be improved (e.g., avoiding globals), but it looks like there's a decent amount of shared code/logic between the two. Can you share which package(s) depend on PlayingCards.jl? I see [FreeCell.jl](https://github.com/scheinerman/FreeCell.jl) 🙂, any others? It'd be helpful to know how much work would be involved.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure it's a bad thing to have more than one package with more-or-less the same functionality.\r\n\r\nI'm fine either way. This is really just a hobby project for me, so I don't mind a little extra work if it helps the community :)\r\n\r\n[noblock]\r\n",
