      "body": "[noblock] Not a strong objection, but with the new name, it's not obvious that the `@here` macro originates from the `ProjectRoot` package. That is, if I saw it in a script, I wouldn't make the connection. So one possibility would be to rename the macro to `@project_root`. Or, as I suggested in https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/99288#issuecomment-1903978986, `HereMacro` might be a suitable package name.",

I don't really like HereMacro because the fact that the main functionality of the package is a macro is mostly an implementation detail.",

      "body": "[noblock] That's true, but it does make it very clear that the package exports the `@here` macro ;-)\r\n\r\nI can only speak for myself, but I would absolutely expect `@project_root(\"path\", \"to\", \"file\")` to construct a file path (even without reading the documentation), as it does. Conversely, I would find `@here` confusing (where's \"here\"? My first guess would be the current folder, i.e. `@__DIR__`). Not being an R user who has ever interacted with the R package that inspired this probably contributes to that confusion.\r\n\r\nSo my first choice would actually be to keep the `ProjectRoot` package name and to rename the macro. I might actually use this package! I was, in fact, considering some similar kind of macro for [QuantumControl.Workflows](https://juliaquantumcontrol.github.io/QuantumControl.jl/dev/api/quantum_control_reference/#QuantumControlWorkflowsLocalAPI), which is where I collect functions similar to DrWatson, but where DrWatson was too opinionated for my typical workflows.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I could get used to `@here`. You could have both names, too, an exported `@project_root` and a non-exported `@here` for users with an R background (`using ProjectRoot: @here` doesn't have the problem of not being obvious). Especially if you want to keep support for a `.here` file.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "[noblock] I've mulled it over and I've come around :) I think you're right that `here` is actually more obscure. There is also a python package **pyprojroot** and an r package **rprojroot** too, so sticking with here doesn't really have that much value after all. Maybe it should just be `@projectroot` rather than `@project_root`; I'll think about it.\r\n\r\nI will make the necessary changes and push an update. I'm glad to hear that you might find it useful!",
