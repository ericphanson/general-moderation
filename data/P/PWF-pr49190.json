Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 8 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to NMF. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  2. Similar to EDF. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to BDF. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to AWS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  5. Similar to XDF.

Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Hello Community!\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the naming guidelines for automatic merging, but.. :)\r\n\r\nPWF.jl is a package exclusively dedicated to reading \".PWF\" files, which is the extension used in the Brazilian Power System's cases. Like CSV.jl, which is dedicated to read/parse CSV files into Julia, PWF.jl would like to be registered exactly like the file extension name. This would improve the package reach in the Electricity power system community\r\n\r\nIs it possible?\r\n\r\nCheers!",
