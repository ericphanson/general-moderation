Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an uppercase letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are uppercase.\n- Name is not at least five characters long\n- Package name similar to 2 existing packages.\n1. Similar to BAT. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n2. Similar to MAT. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

PATHlib_jll compiles a wrapper @chkwon wrote around an out-dated release of the source-code by a third-party company. PATHSolver is a Julia wrapper for PATHlib_jll and does not provide an interface to JuMP.\r\n\r\nPATH.jl uses binaries provided by the original author of the C library (who is a collaborator on PATH.jl), integrates directly with JuMP. The naming follows the precedent in the JuMP ecosystem of naming the package directly after the underlying solver, including ALL-CAPS (e.g., https://github.com/jump-dev/CPLEX.jl) and names shorter than 5 characters (https://github.com/jump-dev/Cbc.jl).\r\n\r\n",
