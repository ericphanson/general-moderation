There is no scanning of random directories as in other tools, that would be another package entirely.\r\n\r\nPkgToSoftwareBOM.jl?  That's not a bad name, I guess I thought at the time it would be too wordy but I could be persuaded.",

      "body": "[noblock] yeah, let me persuade you ;) SBOM rides against the first rule of of package naming guidelines which suggests avoiding unannotated acronyms in the names. There are examples where this is possible though, e.g. `GalacticCMAEvolutionStrategy.jl`. Pretty wordy, but unambiguous ;)\r\n\r\n`PkgToSoftwareBOM.jl` sounds good especially given the tradition of starting names with [Pkg](https://juliahub.com/ui/Search?q=Pkg&type=packages) (57 of them!) :D",
