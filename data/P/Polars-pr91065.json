Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 2 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Colors. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 1.97 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to Solaris. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "This looks nice in principle, but I would put a package with this name under a bit more scrutiny: The Python `polars` seems like a pretty high-profile package, and having a `Polars` Julia package as a wrapper (with that name) signals that it's the authorative package for `polars` in Julia.\r\n\r\nIs this package prepared to live up to that expectation? Usually, for \"authorative\" packages, I would consider criteria like the following:\r\n\r\n* The package should be hosted under a Github Organization, not a personal account, ideally with multiple people\r\n* There should be maintainer with a permanent position or long-term funding, or a company/group that intends to fund someone as a future maintainer\r\n* The package should have reasonably complete documentation\r\n\r\nIf the package isn't expected to have a long-term maintainer, a less authoritative sounding name would be more appropriate\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

      "body": "Thanks for taking a look at the registration. I personally don't think we should hold package registration to leave the name for an hypothetical \"authoritative\" package. Indeed, it seems quite a few packages in the ecosystem started as individual contributions (Arrow, DuckDB) and I think that's great. A few more data-points for polars case:\r\n\r\n - [a polars Julia wrapper has been requested for a while.](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/547)\r\n - [polars maintainers stated they have no bandwidth to maintain such package.](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/547#issuecomment-820225539)\r\n - the new polars frontends such as [r-polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars) are also community maintained.\r\n - I found no existing Julia wrapper.\r\n\r\nNow I also understand the concern for the bus-factor. I added more features and [docs](https://pangoraw.github.io/Polars.jl/docs) in the package since the initial registration attempt and I am looking forward to collaborating with other interested contributors/users. \r\n\r\nFor posterity, any long-term position maintainer in a company or group who is looking to take over the maintenance of the package (or rewrite it from scratch) can contact me, my email is in the Project.toml.",
