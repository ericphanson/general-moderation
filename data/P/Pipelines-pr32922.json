Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to DLPipelines. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

      "body": "Hi Julia Contributor,\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that the package name (Pipelines.jl) is similar to another existing package (DLPipelines.jl). After carefully checking the contents of two packages, I found two packages serve for different purposes:\r\n\r\n- **Pipelines** focused on building command-line pipelines, and native Julia pipelines (in the future). It supports resuming interrupted tasks, dependency check, inputs/outputs validation, and so on.\r\n\r\n- **DLPipelines** stands for Deep Learning data Pipelines. This includes every data transformation besides the model itself: preprocessing and augmenting the data before feeding it into the model and decoding the model’s outputs to targets.\r\n\r\nAnd `Pipelines` really fits the package contents. If it is possible, I suggest leaving my package name Pipelines.jl unchanged.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\n\r\nEric",
