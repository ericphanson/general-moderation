      "body": "Hi, I am trying to register a new package named PDELib.jl . I am aware that it is not fully follwing the package naming guidelines. The registrator was blocke due to assuming similarity with CDDLib.\r\n\r\nThe reason for registering the package under this name is that it is aimed to be  the successor of a C++/Python based project  [pdelib](https://pdelib.org), so  the name is kind of fixed (besides of moving to camel case).    \r\n\r\nSo herewith I am asking for an exception from the naming rule.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for consideration!",
