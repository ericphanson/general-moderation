The more polished and complete the package documentation is and the more functionality is already in the package, the more likely I would be to support a very general package name like this, personally. Maybe this package just needs a bit more work before it’s ready for registration – it definitely doesn’t look like a 1.0 release at this point. Placeholder registrations are against the guidelines, so registering just to take the name is not the right to do.",
