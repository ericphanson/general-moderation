The idea started with a PR at Pluto where **one** precompile statement reduces the time for first X from 11 to 8 seconds (https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/pull/1934) while only introducing 0.2 seconds to `@time using Pluto`.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I'm a bit torn here. Yes, the name is very generic and therefore I understand that is an issue. On the other hand, I cannot think of any other use-case for this name and also  `Memoize.jl` which exports `@memoize` is also not called `MemoizeMacro` or whatever.\r\n\r\nIt would also be a bit sad having to type \"using PrecompileMacro: @precompile\" or something. Preferably, this macro would have been in Julia base since 1.6, but having a package Precompile is quite reasonable too, I think.\r\n\r\nAs a compromise, I've now added Tim and Fredrik as a collaborator to the package. This mitigates the issue where I disappear or whatever and people cannot get hold of the name anymore. I'm also happy to move the repo into an organisation if that's preferred.",
