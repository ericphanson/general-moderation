      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Could I suggest renaming this to `PairingHamiltonians`? That is, use the pluralized name, as is generally [recommended for Julia packages](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-rules) (point 3).\r\n\r\nYou would then also rename the main data structure in the package from `Pairing_Hamiltonian` to `PairingHamiltonian`. The almost universal convention for type names in Julia is to use CamelCase, not underscores (which, instead, are use for function names). In fact, the clash between `PairingHamiltonian` as a package name and a type name is exactly _why_ package/module names should be pluralized.",
