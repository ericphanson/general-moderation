It would be a lot easier to understand what the package is capable of doing if you wrote the README. I see that you have docstrings, which is great! It would be relatively straightforward to setup a GitHub hosted page using Documenter.jl so that users can understand how to interact with your API.\r\n\r\nBased on the [Package Naming Guidelines](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines) to \"avoid acronyms\", it could be a bit easier to read and aligned with the guidelines to name your package something like ParallelFEM.jl.",
