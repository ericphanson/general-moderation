      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) which are not met ❌\n\n- Repo URL does not end with /name.jl.git, where name is the package name\n- I was not able to install the package (i.e. `Pkg.add(\"Powsybl\")` failed). See the AutoMerge logs for details.\n- I was not able to load the package (i.e. `import Powsybl` failed). See the AutoMerge logs for details.\n\n## 3. *Needs action*: here's what to do next\n\n1. Please try to update your package to conform to these guidelines. The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\n2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\n\nIf you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [public Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) for better visibility.\n\n## 4. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

In such cases, as far as I understand, the way to handle this is via a [JLL package](https://docs.binarybuilder.org/dev/jll/), and then sometimes a normal Julia package on top of that JLL. It might be good to get more information about this process on the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org) or [Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/)",

The readme will come very soon and I already merged the matching jll package in Yggdrasil / JuliaBinaryWrappers.\r\n\r\n* I am right now fixing the issue of submodules, as far as I understand we cannot automatically merge a package with any git submodule ? I have a workaround ready if that is the case.\r\n* I do not understand the issue \"Repo URL does not end with /name.jl.git, where name is the package name\", it this case sensitive ? My package name is Powsybl but the url is /powsybl.jl.git.\r\n\r\nAlso to be coherent with the jll package and more friendly to people importing the package I would rather keep a simple capitalization \"Powsybl\".",
