Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 6 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Fri. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 1.40 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to Pkg.

However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

Enzyme for instance has little to do with enzymes for a biologist using Julia. But it's a great and recognizable name. \n\nI also would never have associated Flux, Lux, Enzyme, Umlaut, Avalon, Torch, Jax, etc with AD and ML before they existed.

Back then, I assume registration was less strict, because the space of possible names felt unlimited. But now we know it isn't, and the space of possible 3-letter packages in particular is not that big. This is especially true when accounting for edit distance constraints.\nI also don't see why there should be an exception for AD / ML packages, or packages from well-regarded developers, who would somehow get a quirkiness pass.\n\nPersonally, I think it's cool that packages have quirky and memorable names. But as a community I feel we may need to draw a line somewhere, and three letters is a good spot for it. If someome came in and wanted to register the quantum physics package Psi.jl, because Psi is the symbol of the wave function, would that be a yes too? Arguably the name has a stronger case for it. But what if the dev were unknown to the people watching the \"new packages\" feed? Regardless of package quality, would they get the same treatment?",
