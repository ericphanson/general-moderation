      "body": "Hi @KristofferC \r\n\r\nPardiso.jl is great! I am not trying to replicate its functionality. \r\n\r\nI need direct access to the low level fortran routines in Pardiso to have fine control. I haven't found so thin wrappers in Pardiso.jl (e.g., is it possible to access `pardiso_64`?) That's why I have written the repo, mainly for my own purposes, but it can be also useful for someone else.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Okay, it would be useful if you could open up an issue on Pardiso.jl with what you need. We could eg add a layer for direct access to the Fortran functions there if you want. \r\n\r\nIt personally feels a bit unnecessary to spread out too much code over different packages about something as specific as just wrapping Pardiso.\r\n\r\nNot that this PR can't be merged, it is just a good long term goal to try have a Pardiso package that works for everyone.

      "body": "Hi @KristofferC \r\n\r\nthanks for your comments. I see your point. It would be much better if Pardiso.jl provides also low level access to the pardiso mkl  subroutines (this is actually what I was looking for at the beginning but didn't find it in the package). \r\n\r\nFirst, I thought to create a fork of Pardiso.jl, add what I needed, and then open a PR. However, two things prevented me of doing this:\r\n\r\n1) I was not able to properly install Pardiso.jl in my system. I think that gcc-6 is not supported. And custom installations of gcc are not supported neither.\r\n\r\n2) The Pardiso.jl does not have Project.toml and a Manifest.toml files. I am quite new in Julia and I don't know how to work with packages that don't follow the new project structure.\r\n\r\nWe can work together to solve these two issues.  Then I can add the functionality of `PardisoMKL.jl` into `Pardiso.jl` (essentially the functions in the API section of the [README.md](https://github.com/fverdugo/PardisoMKL.jl/blob/master/README.md) file with perhaps slightly different names if you wish)\r\n\r\nFor me would be nice to contribute to Pardiso.jl and for you would be nice to have Pardiso.jl improved.\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion?\r\n",
