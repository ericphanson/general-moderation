      "body": "Thank you for submitting your package! Could you add a little bit more documentation before registering? Specifically, in addition to the description of the package's purpose already there, that would be a small usage example in the README. An important part of packages in General is that any potential user can figure out what the package is about and how to get started with using it. That is really difficult when there is no documentation.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, I definitely recommend setting up a [Documenter](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/)-based documentation. Before a `v1.0` release, or for smaller packages that can be effectively described entirely with their `README`, that's not a requirement, though. I would recommend using a version number v0.1.0 for the initial registration. To the extent that version numbers <0.1 are used in semantic versioning at all, they typically indicate a state of development that is not yet functional, and which would thus not be suitable for registration.",
