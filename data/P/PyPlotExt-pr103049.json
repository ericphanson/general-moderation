Also, the `Ext` suffix has the connotation of extension modules, which might be problematic.\r\n> \r\n> P.S.: on that note: the code in this package might actually be suited for an extension module inside one of your existing packages.\r\n\r\nNo. I do not have any other plotting package and also no general control package where this could be added.\r\n\r\nI don't think it is possible to add this code to PyPlot because I overwrite the display() function, and my plot functions return a different type compared to PyPlot. So while I understand your concerns, I think I need to create a new package to achieve the following feature:\r\n- possibility to store plots in an high-level format (with the possibility to zoom in, change the header etc) on disk and to display these plots after loading from disk automatically\r\n\r\nI intend to to add a package extension for Bode plots etc, because they would need ControlSystemsBase as dependency which a a huge dependency and not needed otherwise.\r\n\r\nI need this package to make plotting easy for students, and I think it can be useful for others. \r\n\r\nAnd a name like \"ControllerDesignPyPlots\" is too limiting, because plots for people who migrate from Simulink to Julia can also be very useful for people who are not doing control design.\r\n\r\nOK, I could consider a name like `EditablePlots` if you think that better matches the key new idea of this package...\r\n[noblock]",

      "body": "> OK, I could consider a name like `EditablePlots` if you think that better matches the key new idea of this package…\r\n\r\nYes, I think a more descriptive name would be good. If the package is specific to `PyPlot`, I'd include that in the name (`EditablePyPlots`). If it might extend to other backends in the future, something like `EditablePlots` would be fine.\r\n\r\nI'm not actually quite sure what the idea of the package is, though. Looking at the README, the example\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> p = plot(X, Y, xlabel=\"X\", ylabel=\"sin\", fig=\"basic\")\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> You can now close the plot window. You can re-display the plot by typing:\r\n>\r\n> ```\r\n> p\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nalready works with standard `Plots.jl`. Likewise, dumping and reloading `p` to a file via JLD2. If the goal is, as you say,\r\n\r\n> possibility to store plots in an high-level format (with the possibility to zoom in, change the header etc) on disk and to display these plots after loading from disk automatically\r\n\r\nthat's already built-in, and then I don't understand then mae `EditablePlots` .\r\n\r\nI couldn't try out `PyPlotExt` directly because `PyPlot` just segfaults on my machine (I find [`PythonCall`](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonCall.jl) to be a much more robust way of calling `matplotlib`). Based on the proposed name `EditablePlots` I'm assuming that in your package, `p` is some kind of mutable object that can be \"edited\" to modify the plot, not just a  `Plots.Plot` object? If that's the case, `EditablePlots`/`EditablePyPlots` seems like a good name, but you'd want to update the README to show the actual feature of the package.\r\n",
