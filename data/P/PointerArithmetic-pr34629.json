      "body": "@giordano this commit was desired to be an update. However, at the moment I committed and mentioned the Registrator, it marked this as a new package (and it will have conflicts, as you can see above). I find it happened because the first version was in the queue to be merged after the mandatory 3 days period, and the Registrator may have not found it. I don't know if the bot will have problems merging the package, but in case of having, it shouldn't be better to delete it, so I can call the Registrator again?",
