That is always super complicated... Today I found this stackoverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48188545/listing-all-commits-given-a-tree-hash-id\r\nwhich gave me the commitid `ccbd5f24c21354eb92682bd8822791d1df7be521`, which indeed is the up-to-date one.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: just seeing that you already merged it ~@fredrikekre Hence this only needs to be merged manually~\r\n(and if you have a hint how to get commitid from git-tree-sha1 in an easy and straightforward manner, that would also help alot)",
