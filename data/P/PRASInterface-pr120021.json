I thought this package was an Interface between `PowerSystems` and `PRAS`, hence the suggestions.\r\n\r\n> similarly we registered in the past PowerModelsInterface.jl\r\n\r\nAt the time that was registered, there weren't as many volunteers reviewing package submissions. Thus, things slipped through the cracks. The name `PowerModelsInterface` has the same issue as `PRASInterface`: an interface is between two things, and the name does not indicate what those two things are. That package would probably not have been merged by today's standards.\r\n\r\n> I don't understand the need to request community feedback\r\n\r\nThe General registry is a community resource, so all registrations will be reviewed\r\n\r\n> for the registration of this package that follows the conventions of our organization\r\n\r\nYou are moving a package from the context of a specific organization to the General registry that addresses the entire community. For people *internal* to NREL-Sienna the name `PRASInterface` makes perfect sense. Someone in the general public does not have that context, so it is not clear what is interfacing with `PRAS` here. This wouldn't be a problem if packages in `Pkg` included the org name. That's something I'd love to have in Julia 2.0, but it's not what we have now. If this package is an interface between PRAS and general code inside your organization (rather than between a particular package like `PowerSystems` and `PRAS`), then probably `SiennaPRASInterface` would be the appropriate name.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Just reread [your original response](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/120021#issuecomment-2495500965)\r\n\r\n> This package is an interface between our data library PowerSystems.jl and PRAS that's where the names comes from.\r\n\r\nSo I didn't just make this up.
