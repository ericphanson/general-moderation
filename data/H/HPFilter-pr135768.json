It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3.

      "body": "> The package also tries to shine light on the lesser known first inventor George Bohlmann of the method\r\n\r\nHow does naming it `HPFilter` do that? Doesn't \"HP\" stand for Hodrick-Prescott?\r\n\r\nThe [naming guidelines](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1) are pretty clear: \"Avoid jargon\", and \"Err on the side of clarity, even if clarity seems long-winded to you.\"\r\n\r\n> It is also common place for juliastats packages to use acronyms like GLM.jl, NMF.jl or a similar naming convention to mine\r\n\r\nThere is probably no chance that `GLM` or `NMF` could be registered today under those names. These packages were registered a long time ago before the naming conventions were enforced in the registry.\r\n\r\n> MLBase.jl\r\n\r\nSometimes the rules can be a little relaxed, especially for non-public-facing \"base\" packages. Also, `ML` is a _very_ commonly understood acronym, so it would be much more acceptable as part of a package name.\r\n\r\nI don't see how a package named `HPFilter` would not be better named `HodrickPrescottFilter`, unless maybe you want to make the argument that statisticians would recognize \"HP Filter\", but not know that it stands for \"Hodrick-Prescott Filter\" (and thus, would have no idea that a package `HodrickPrescottFilter` would implement HP Filters)\r\n\r\n[noblock]\r\n",
