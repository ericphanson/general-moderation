I've been PackageSpec'ing in the meantime, but that gets cumbersome with as many filter packages as we have.  The v0.16 release still requires further work and finalization of exposed API, thus I think it would be nice to have these registered in advance of those v0.16 HDF5 changes, which is   independent of the H5Z* subpackage work. \r\n\r\n",
