Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- There is no compat entry for `julia`.\n- No licenses detected in the package's top-level folder. An OSI-approved license is required.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

This implies a reasonably complete set of features and decent documentation. See the guidelines about [Should I register my package now?](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md#should-i-register-my-package-now)\r\n\r\nIf the package isn't ready for the general public yet, but you want to register it for your own use or to make the development workflow easier, a [LocalRegistry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl) is usually the way to go.\r\n\r\n> Could you please also comment on the recurring error  xvfb cannot install and it says registry dirty.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you're referring to.\r\n\r\n> If I can resolve this, I can upload the full package (translation from the R package).\r\n\r\nThe package should be \"complete\" *before* you register it.\r\n\r\n> Sorry for the multiple PRs, was not intentional, not sure how this happened, but I will make sure it won't happen again.\r\n\r\nThat's okay. Usually, as long as you keep the package name and UUID the same, you can just retrigger the registration the same way you originally submitted it, and it should update the existing PR.",
