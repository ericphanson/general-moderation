Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Version number is not allowed to contain prerelease data\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: Crayons, GLPK, IterTools, IterativeSolvers, JLD2, NearestNeighbors, Polyhedra, SpecialFunctions, StaticArrays\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

This package can generate meshes on polygonal or periodic domains and provides Finite Volume methods for high dimensional meshes. Based on the algorithm published in VoronoiGraph, HighVoronoi offers further features including mesh refinement, integration of functions and fast calculation of periodic grids. This package uses fewer calculations and linear equations than classical algorithms and comes with data sets for convex and bounded or unbounded domains. Additionally, it allows for setting up linear equations for a finite volume Voronoi discretization of an elliptic PDE.\n<!-- END RELEASE NOTES -->",
