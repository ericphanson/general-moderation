The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an uppercase letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are uppercase.\n- Name is not at least five characters long\n- Package name similar to 5 existing packages.\n1. Similar to TBLIS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1.\n2. Similar to ULID.

      "body": "Hi.\r\n\r\nThis is a wrapper for [BLIS](https://github.com/flame/blis).\r\nThe package name does not meet auto-merging requirements but hopefully it's acceptable as it follows term 6 in [Pkg.jl Name Guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1)\r\n\r\nFor [TBLIS](https://github.com/devinamatthews/tblis), the library itself is created in a fashion similar to BLIS and provides also linear algebra operations. I suppose it'll not make much confusion on the users' side although TBLIS.jl is beyond my control.",
