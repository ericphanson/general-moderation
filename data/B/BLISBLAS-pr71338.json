Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

I do though see \"blis_jll\" (EDIT: I see it was registered long time ago, so likely needs to stay that way, and not worth it to add/replace with the other) and maybe it too should be upper-cased \"BLIS_jll\" (that probably needs to be registered first). I don't know of a policy for or against.\r\n\r\nI do see tblis_jll, likely related with lower case though, and CHiPPS_BLIS_jll: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/39082 likely unrelated.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

Please merge 😄  (FWIW, if anything, I would think it should have the more premium name BLIS.jl but that's already taken by an older more manual effort.)\r\n\r\nAs for blis_jll.jl, I guess the name had been chosen because the source github repo is named https://github.com/flame/blis. However, in their own README, they also refer to it as BLIS. I'm not sure it is worth to change blis_jll.jl -> BLIS_jll.jl. I don't have a strong opinion. In any case, this matter should probably be discussed in a separate issue over in the Yggdrasil repo. I can switch to a differently named dependency in BLISBLAS.jl in the future.",
