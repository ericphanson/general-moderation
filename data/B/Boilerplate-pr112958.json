However, they also seem like they'd be mostly useful for development workflows and testing, rather than actual package code. Utilities for development workflows generally wouldn't be dependencies, and don't absolutely need to be registered. There's no rule against it, of course, so if it's generally useful, it's fine to register it.\r\n\r\nA lot of these are also small one-liners. It's often better to copy in one-liners into a package code rather than adding a dependency. At least for anything that doesn't fit into a `DebuggingMacros` package.

It's not going to clash with anything. I don't think we should interpret the rule against \"personal utility packages\" that strictly. These packages, with an appropriate and specific name, can serve as dependencies for other more broadly useful packages someone may want to register (since all dependencies of registered packages must also be registered). Organizations often have various packages that really only serve as dependencies. I have a `QuantumControlTestUtils` myself! Why not give individuals similar leeway? If it's useful as a dependency for something useful, that should be good enough, assuming the name is highly specific.",

As far as I can tell, out of the macros listed above, it only uses `@async_showerr`, and only in one place. I would never add a dependency in such a situation. Dependencies are not \"for free\". Not for your users, where additional dependencies increase project instantiation time and open up the possibilities of conflicts, but also not for you. I think you might underestimate the overhead of having to manage the development workflows of multiple packages.\r\n\r\nI can say pretty confidently that none of the relatively simple macros currently in Boilerplate justify that kind of trouble.\r\nI would copy in the one or two definitions of these macros that you're actually using into each package, not load them as a dependency. Actually, I'm not even sure the `@async_showerr` macro / avoiding boilerplate is a good idea in general. Now, when I look at your code, I have to figure out what `@async_showerr` does. It would be much better to just write out that boilerplate.\r\n\r\nIt seems all of your current work is AI related. Maybe you want to think about which packages you'll really want to push out, and put them into an organization (and remember: maintaining too many packages adds *a lot* of overhead for you, so it might be best to consolidate). Then *maybe* that org could have a `<OrgName>Core` or `<OrgName>Utils` package that collects these common boilerplate utilities, for use by all the packages in the org. I think that would be a much better solution than `EasyPrint` or some similar package name that's both relatively general and non-descriptive and probably wouldn't be used by anyone but you.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you'll run into problems with the package name `AISH` when you try to register. I would recommend renaming it to `AIShell` or something similar that matches the package naming guidelines.",

But during development and anything like that I use it a lot. And this is just one package. Also just noting that `Anthropic.jl` would also use that `@async_showerr` macro, but I removed and now it send silent errors with the `@async ` which is very dangerous. And all due to I want that package to be available. \r\n\r\nI use these `@show @sizes @typeof @display` functions very frequently. \r\nI understand that you are not huge fan of these. It is similar like `@show`. Are you fan of `@show` or you go with `println` most of the time? It will be the same with these, please take my word for this as I cannot give you better proof now enough easily!\r\n\r\nI really have to push these package up. Also I am open to maintenance as much package as possible. \r\n\r\nRegarding the dependency issues, I understand your concern. But it isn't a must. So if a person want to clean down his code base it is up to his decision. I can also clean down. But to be honest the `@async_showerr` reduce the code lines from extra +4-5 lines to zero extra line. It is REALLY decreasing the cognitive load when it comes to Julia developing and it worth the trade off. \r\nI don't know what can I do, but I really want to use these macros. I am open to anything, just let me know what is the way to accept these in the General registry, so I can move forward and help the community much better. \r\n\r\nAlso I can assure you I won't allow any type piracy as I am well aware of what that is, as I was already involved in many things with that due to the `RelevanceStacktrace` and many other Stacktrace modifier module.  \r\n",
