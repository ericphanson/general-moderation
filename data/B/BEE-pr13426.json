However, you will need to wait until a registry maintainer manually approves the name.**\n- Name is not at least five characters long\n- Version number is not 0.0.1, 0.1.0, 1.0.0, or X.0.0\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.
