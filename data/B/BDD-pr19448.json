My only concern was already existing users that might have their package and code break (plus `using BDD` was such a simple quaint one-liner). But on second thought, I doubt anyone is actually using my package, so why not. Better to have it on the general registry. Is there a way to have both ways? As in, leave the repo as `BDD.jl` but have it on the general registry as `BinaryDecisionDiagrams`?",
