These are their most public status. `BioGPS.jl` is the newer version of https://github.com/UCSD-CCAL/onco_gps_paper_analysis . `Immunogram.jl` and `TCRGram.jl` are current projects at our lab and co-developed by Azam M at Mark Davis Lab at Stanford. https://github.com/immunogram is the organization these will migrate to. `GSEA.jl` is ready and will be transferred to https://github.com/GSEA-MSigDB. We just submitted a grant, which requires this to be done as well. Finally, https://github.com/guardiome 's new backend relies on this package as well. This is why I wanted to register this package so that I can get to them one by one. ",

      "body": "Thanks for the comment. I see your points. I agree with you. And I have made issues based on your comments. Thank you.\r\n\r\nBut I think this package is valid to register.\r\n\r\nFirst, by choice, we tried to have as many small functions, making it easy to split it as needed later. The API-level functions are not in the \"Core\" package by design.\r\n\r\nNext, no package is perfect, especially in the early days. Often packages evolve, compartmentalize, and mature. I believe this is the case for `BioinformaticsCore.jl`. The bioinformatics ecosystem needs work in Julia. And it does not come near perfect overnight. The good ecosystems develop - as needed - one part at a time. Often, they start as a person's personal repository and then get community feedback, branching into more packages and even into an organization. I wish for such a trajectory for this package. Yet now, the most important thing is that we keep going forward and make things people want to use.\r\n\r\nI believe that this package should have the right to develop into an echo system slowly, as needed. Over time, this should contain lower-level functions, reusing others' stable ones as much, while enabling higher-level bioinformatics functions.\r\n\r\n\"Premature optimization is the beginning of all evil\" is a famous quote in computer science. A perfectly organized package that no one uses does not grow. But a package that is used more and scrutinized more can develop into one with a elegant structure. I hope you could give our community a chance.",

      "body": "@KwatMDPhD In browsing the package, the code appears to be utilities being prepared in support of bioinformatics capabilities - and perhaps a name that suggests that is better. Later as the package grows, it should be possible to refactor it and have a BioinformaticsCore.jl.\r\n\r\nAlso, the other reason to avoid calling this Core is that it has a large footprint in terms of package dependencies. The Project.toml will pull in a lot of dependencies, and you probably want a tighter core package with core computational capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is that when coming up with an opinionated set of packages for a domain, people often use a name for the whole project - like Flux.jl, Turing.jl, JuMP.jl, SciML, etc. Then as interfaces standardize, a core package is often refactored out to allow multiple implementations of the abstract APIs.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to come up with a different name for this ecosystem of packages you mentioned? I think it may serve the purpose better. Apologies, that this may need some refactoring and renaming.",
