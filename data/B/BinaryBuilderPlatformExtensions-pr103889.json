      "body": "Can you give some background on this? It's a bit of an unusual monorepo setup…\r\n\r\nThe repo description says \"Temporary repository to hold BinaryBuilder rewrite\". Is it intentional / a good idea to register new packages from a \"temporary\" location?\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add a README to the repository to give a bit of explanation for people stumbling across it?\r\n\r\nNormally, for new registrations, I would ask that packages have at least minimal README. Even if they're secondary/extension packages, the README should still give a paragraph of context for the package, and link to the documentation of the main package. In this case, BinaryBuilder already has great documentation at https://binarybuilder.org. But I still think it would be a good idea to add README (also for how the package might show up on JuliaHub?)\r\n\r\n(I'm just blocking this temporarily to give @staticfloat a chance to confirm; this is not an objection)\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

      "body": "Those are very fair points.  I've added `README.md` files to all subpackages and for the `BB2.jl` repository overall.\r\n\r\nThe background is that this repository is a complete rewrite of `BinaryBuilder.jl`, and while I originally thought that I would eventually replace `BinaryBuilder.jl` with this new code and release a breaking version of `BinaryBuilder.jl` with the new code, I now think that we're going to need to maintain the old `BinaryBuilder.jl` for a while, and so it's probably best to just have them as two separate packages.  Therefore, I have taken away the \"temporary\" from the repository description.\r\n\r\nAs part of the rewrite process, I am factoring out many pieces of functionality into their own sub-packages for maintainability, package precompilation/load time, and ecosystem-reuse reasons.  However it's still very convenient to be able to co-develop all the packages, hence the monorepo setup.\r\n\r\nThis leaves open the question, should I re-name the repository to `BinaryBuilder2.jl`, or just continue to leave it as `BB2.jl`?  I don't have a strong opinion, but if I should rename it then I should do it now before I start registering all of those subpackages. ",
