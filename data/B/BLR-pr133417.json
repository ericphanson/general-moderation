The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\n2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\n\nIf you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.

To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

I quite like `BLR.jl` for this package and am hoping somenoe can manually override or suggest an alternative. \r\n\r\nThanks and sorry for the inconvenience.",

      "body": "As already hinted at on Slack, there is probably very little (if any) chance to have a three-letter acronym like `BLR` accepted. Since the General registry is a shared resource the entire Julia community, even if an acronym might be commonly understood in a narrow domain of potential users of the package, it should not be used as a package name. In this case, `BLR` could mean \"Broad-Line Region\", [or it could (more likely) mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLR) \"Base Lending Rate\".\r\n\r\nMy recommendation would be to write out and probably pluralize the acronym, as `BroadLineRegions`. Unlike in other communities, long and descriptive package names are strongly encouraged in the Julia ecosystem, see the [Package naming rules](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-rules). This can take some getting used to for people coming from other languages, but once you do, you will find that it makes the ecosystem much more approachable. Fully writing out the acronym would allow you to still use the `BLR` abbreviation in your documentation and \"marketing\", up to and including recommending\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport BroadLineRegions as BLR\r\n```\r\n\r\nas a way to use your package.",
