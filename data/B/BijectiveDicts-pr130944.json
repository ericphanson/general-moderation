Note that adjoint is applied recursively to elements\r\n\r\nUsing `adjoint` for something that does not fit that description seems like it would be a footgun, or at least bad style. I could see a `BijectiveDicts.adjoint` that has no relation to `Base.adjoint` being okay semantically, but that's probably an impractical name collision. Thus, I would recommend an entirely different name. Maybe something like `inverted` / `invert` / `invert!`",

True that the inverse of a *number* is generally interpreted as the multiplicative inverse, but for a bijection *f*, the inverse of *f* is a new function that has the property that *f* composed with the inverse of *f* is the identity function. Multiplication doesn’t make sense for functions, but composition does. This is 100% consistent with matrices. Multiplication of matrices is also composition of them as linear transformations. The inverse of a matrix is also its inverse in terms of composition. Also `inv` is easier to remember and type. \r\n\r\n[noblock]",

Also, I got rid of the `domain` and `range` fields, which IMO are not necessary since they are the keys of the dicts.\r\n\r\n@scheinerman what do you think? are you willing to accept the changes to Bijections and do a breaking v0.2 release? or should we keep them separate? i can write a PR if so.\r\n\r\nEDIT: There's also another important detail and its about the behavior of `inv`. AFAIK Bijections returns a copy of the underneath dictionaries, but BijectiveDicts returns the same dictionaries just switched for performance.",
