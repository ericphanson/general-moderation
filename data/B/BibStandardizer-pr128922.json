      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "> A small package to standardize LaTeX bibitems to my liking.\r\n\r\nThat sounds a very borderline to being a \"personal utility\", which [wouldn't be suitable for registration in General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#should-i-register-my-package-now). Are you sure that it's necessary or useful to register the package at this point? It would help if it had functionality to standardize bibitems not just to _your_ liking, but to the (potentially different) liking of a broad audience. That is, to be suitable for General with a broad name like that, it should have options to, e.g., customize the format for citation keys, or which fields to clean up",

      "body": "IMO, it would also be possible to register this under a highly distinctive name, e.g., `PerbyeBibStandardizer`. Technically, that still violates the rule against \"personal utility packages\", but I don't really see the point of interpreting that rule that strictly. Others might differ on that. _My_ objection is only for a package with a general name that is not general in scope.\r\n\r\nBut setting up a personal `LocalRegistry`, or just letting people [`Pkg.add` it as an unregistered package](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/managing-packages/#Adding-unregistered-packages) is also a good solution. As long as a package is not a dependency of some other registered package, registration in General is not an absolute necessity.",
