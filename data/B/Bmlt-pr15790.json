      "body": "@oxinabox  I agree with you and I am eventually ok for that name, still I would have preference for the original `Bmlt` name if possible. The reasons is that (1) I will refer to the package always as a \"toolkit\", so I believe \"t\" is somehow expected in the name (a bit like \"SciKit\"), and (2) I may want in the future to change the meaning of the leading \"B\" from \"Beta\" (the name of my university lab) to a more universal  (and perhaps more appropriate) \"Basic\" meaning...\r\n\r\nSo, if possible I would stay with the original name `Bmlt`, otherwise no pbm, I'll use the suggested \"BetaML\", thank you.

Whether we want them to or not, names matter; if you want this to have a chance at success, I would suggest a name that is more harmonious with the Julian style. BetaML, as Lyndon suggested, seems like a good name, for example. If you're going to stick with Bmlt then you should at least capitalize all the letters to conform to the Julia convention of capitalizing acronyms, so the package would be `BMLT` instead.",
