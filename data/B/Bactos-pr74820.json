Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to Baytes. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I believe the similarity between Bactos and Baytes is not a big issue, since the two packages occupy two very different niches and seem unlikely to be confused with each other.\r\n\r\nNames like \"Bacteria\" or \"Microbes\" could probably suit my package but I'm not sure I want to reserve such an all-encompassing name.\r\nIn the same vein of point 5 in the package naming guidelines, my package implements some agent-based approaches to a rather broad (but definitely not comprehensive) class of bacterial movement behaviors.\r\nI am currently implementing different models and providing features based fundamentally on my own research interests, without relying on any specific, overarching, framework (which simply doesn't exist in the field afaik).\r\nIt's definitely not the only way to perform agent-based simulations of bacteria, and someone interested in different aspects of bacterial behavior could build a package relying on different core assumptions, which would be *significantly* different from mine.\r\n\r\n\"Bactos\" is a sort of \"nickname\" that I've sometimes heard people use to colloquially refer to bacteria (or more often \"bugs\", but I'm not going with that...), and I think it fits the package.",
