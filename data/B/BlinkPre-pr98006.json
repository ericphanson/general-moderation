      "body": "@alexriss, it is possible to add a package with hotfixes without it being registered (even without the fixes being merged) by specifying a repo url and branch name. The only reason to make a separate package and register it is if there are multiple other packages that depend Blink.jl and want different stability levels than each other.\r\n\r\nI'd also note that \r\n\r\n> \"Empty\" packages that do not yet have functionality are not ready to be registered.\r\n\r\n([source](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md))\r\n\r\nAnd the src diff between this and Blink.jl is currently empty, so I do not think this is ready for registration quite yet.\r\n\r\nDo @pfitzseb, @MikeInnes, @nhdaly, or other maintainers of Blink.jl endorse this project?",

      "body": "@LilithHafner Thanks a lot for the fast response. The thing is that my app SpmImageTycoon relies very heavily on Blink. My app is geared towards end users (it is a GUI app) and not towards coders. And I want them to be able to just install it and start it very easily. And I have not found a way to specify a specific branch or commit in the project compats.\r\n\r\nThe current release of Blink hangs with Julia 1.10 during precompilation, so my app is not working (the problems are fixed on github, just that the version is not released yet). I had a similar problem when when Julia 1.9 was released, so I thought the best way to keep my app working is to have a designated prerelease package. \r\n\r\nAnd this is in no way meant as criticism of the maintainers - Blink.jl is a great package, I really really like it and I am very grateful to the creators and maintainers, who are doing a great job! Just that it makes me nervous that my app currently can't be installed.\r\n",
