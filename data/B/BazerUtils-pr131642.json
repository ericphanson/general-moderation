It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3.

Anything that involves multiple interdependent unregistered packages quickly becomes a nightmare (although the recently [added `[sources]` feature](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/toml-files/#The-%5Bsources%5D-section) improves the situation considerably). But \"registered somewhere\" can (and often should) be a [`LocalRegistry`](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl). In contrast, the `General` registry is for when a package is ready to be used by a wider audience. There is also the rule that packages registered in `General` can only depend on other packages also registered in `General`. But until that point, registration in `General` is, strictly speaking, \"optional\".  Of course, when a package is sufficiently \"useful\" and \"stable\", it is nice to register it in `General` even if it is not a dependency for some other package, just to make it easily available to the wider community.\r\n\r\n> If you think this does not pass the bar (which I agree it might not) I think you should block it\r\n\r\nIt's probably an edge case. Personally, I don't see any immediate _harm_ in letting the registration go through (especially given the non-general name that is unlikely to cause any conflicts with future registered packages). I just wanted to clarify the role of the `General` registry, and then you're probably in a much better position to decide what the best course of action is.\r\n\r\nSo, it's up to you. [Your comment](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/131642#issuecomment-2912518997) is currently blocking, so unless you edit it to contain [noblock], the registration will remain unmerged until the bot closes it after 30 days of inactivity.",
