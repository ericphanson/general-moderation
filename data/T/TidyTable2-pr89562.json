      "body": "I just basically have a problem with the package name `TidyTable2` if there's a package `TidyTable`, and the two aren't related in some very direct way, by the original authors or with the original author's blessing – as in \"`TidyTable2` is a rewrite of `TidyTable`\".\r\n\r\nI didn't initially realize that [`TidyTable`](https://github.com/kdpsingh/TidyTable.jl) wasn't actually registered. That makes things *more* confusing, though: I really don't think there should be a `TidyTable2` package in the Registry if there's no `TidyTable` package.\r\n\r\nNow, if `TidyTable` turns out to be an appropriate name for the new package (possibly not, see below), I think you should actually register it as `TidyTable`. Certainly, the polite thing to do in that case would be to let @kdpsingh weigh in. It doesn't seem like the original `TidyTable` is very actively developed, and also @kdpsingh seems to be the lead for [Tidier.jl](https://github.com/TidierOrg/Tidier.jl) / the [Tidier Org](https://github.com/TidierOrg). So, maybe the original `TidyTable` was just a prototype and the name is actually available now?\r\n\r\nI have zero background in R, and specifically, I don't really know what the \"tidy-verse\" and \"data.table\" are. So I can't tell if `TidyTable` would be an appropriate name for this package. But from your own description (unless I'm misunderstanding what you're saying)\r\n\r\n> In the R language, data processing can be divided into two main genres, namely data.table and tidyverse. The basic data type of data.table and tidyverse are data.table and tibble respectively. TidyTable2 belongs the former\r\n\r\nit sounds like `TidyTable` is very much the wrong name for this package, as it emulates `data.table` and *not* the \"tidyverse\" — so why is there \"Tidy\" in the name?\r\n\r\nI'd really like for @kdpsingh and maybe some other people with an R background to take a look at this to sort out the `TidyTable`/`TidyTable2` question and maybe to propose a suitable package name.\r\n\r\nNone of this touches in any way on the functionality of the package. Again, I'm in no position to judge, but this definitely looks to me like it should be registered, the only question being the package name.",

      "body": "[noblock]\n\nThanks for looping me into the discussion.\n\nTidyTable.jl (which I developed but never registered) was named TidyTable because it directly wraps an R package named \"tidytable\" (see here: https://github.com/markfairbanks/tidytable). The R tidytable package uses the R data.table package as a backend, but the syntax is designed to match the R tidyverse syntax. I may register this package in the future simply as a teaching tool for how to wrap R code in Julia macros, but it's not intended for serious use (and has been replaced by Tidier.jl).\n\nTidyTable2.jl appears to implement aspects of the R data.table R package using a 100% Julia approach. This is great because data.table in R has many fans. However, in my opinion, the name TidyTable2 is confusing mainly because R's data.table package is very different from the tidyverse in terms of its syntax, so there's no reason to include the word \"Tidy\" in the package name. I don't have any issues with the name conflicting with TidyTable -- more that there's no need to refer to it as \"tidy\" when it's not related to the tidyverse in any way.\n\nI'd suggest naming this package after the data.table package, or some play on words like DataChairs.jl.\n\nWill let you take the discussion from here -- just wanted to share my thoughts. Thanks, and nice work again.",
