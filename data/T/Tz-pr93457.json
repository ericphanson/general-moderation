      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: Documenter\n- Package name similar to 9 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Tk. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1. Normalized visual distance 2.36 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to Tar. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to Z3. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to Tau. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  5. Similar to Try. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  6. Similar to TCX. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  7. Similar to H3. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  8. Similar to GR. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  9. Similar to ITK. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

However there is a reason why any member of the community can weigh in on package registrations. The namespace is limited, and registering tons of near-empty packages with limited scope makes it harder for users to recognize the really useful and central ones. For instance it's a good thing Optimization.jl wasn't already taken when the big SciML wrapper emerged, otherwise it would be named something like OptimizationSolverUnifiedInterface.jl.\n\nIn its current state, your package mostly seems useful to yourself.\nYou're more than welcome to expand its functionalities, clearly justify its existence and pick a longer, more explicit name.
