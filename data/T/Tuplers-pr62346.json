      "body": "Hey @alkan, I have some concerns about the implementation of the package.  The way this package seems to work is that a `Tupler` stores an `Expr(:tuple)` and then `push!`ing to it pushes to that expression's arguments and then `build(::Tupler)` will `eval` the  expression. Because of this, some surprising things can happen for instance if someone `push!`es a `Symbol` or an `Expr` to a `Tupler`. For instance:\r\n```julia\r\njulia> let t = Tupler()\r\n           push!(t, :hi)\r\n           build(t)\r\n       end\r\nERROR: UndefVarError: hi not defined\r\n[...]\r\n\r\njulia> let t = Tupler()\r\n           push!(t, :(1 + 1))\r\n           build(t)\r\n       end\r\n(2,)\r\n\r\njulia> let t = Tupler()\r\n           push!(t, Expr(:call, :pwd))\r\n           build(t)\r\n       end\r\n(\"/Users/mason\",)\r\n```\r\nwhich I would say is not good behaviour, and potentially dangerous. Besides this, using eval in this way is going to be quite slow. \r\n\r\nInstead, I'd probably just have the `Tupler` store an `Array{Any}` and `push!` to that array and then convert it to a `Tuple` at the end. E.g.\r\n```julia\r\njulia> let a = Any[]\r\n           push!(a, :hi)\r\n           push!(a, :(1 + 1))\r\n           push!(a, Expr(:call, :pwd))\r\n           Tuple(a)\r\n       end\r\n(:hi, :(1 + 1), :(pwd()))\r\n```\r\nThis will also be pretty slow due to the array, and the dynamic dispatch, but it'll be strictly faster than the current implementation, and more correct / safe.",
