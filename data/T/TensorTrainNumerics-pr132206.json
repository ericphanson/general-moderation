So unless you're planning major revisions of the API in the near future, I'd just remove the \"work in progress\" notices. Why `v1.0.1`, though? Wouldn't you want to start with `v1.0.0`?",

      "body": "> should I change the version to v1.0.0 and call the register bot again?\r\n\r\nI would! And yes, you just call the bot the same way you called it originally.\r\n\r\n> I removed the work in progess on [this branch](https://github.com/MartinMikkelsen/TensorTrainNumerics.jl/tree/solvers) which I plan to merge soon.\r\n\r\nI’d retrigger the registration after that merge, then, presumably.\r\n\r\n> I wanted to keep the work in progress until I have tested the package with Aqua and added coverage.\r\n\r\nThat’s definitely a good idea. Unless you’re absolutely sure that that additional testing won’t discover any problems that require breaking changes to the API, I’d wait with 1.0 until they’re in place. You could also make the initial release a 0.1 version and then tag 1.0 as soon as the extra tests are in place and have shown the API to be okay. Personally, I often like to treat registered 0.x versions as “release candidates” for 1.0, to make sure the API has no major problems that are revealed as people start using it. That doesn’t mean getting stuck on 0.x: Definitely tag 1.0 as soon as the library is “stable” by any reasonable definition. It certainly doesn’t require any breaking change to go from 0.x to 1.0.\r\n\r\nThese things are ultimately up to you, though.",
