It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3.

The latter should be updated by this release. The [dev](https://targene.github.io/TmleCLI.jl/dev/) contains the changed name TmleCLI.jl. TmleCLI stands for TMLE command line interface, it is a companion package to the [TMLE](https://github.com/TARGENE/TMLE.jl) package. It is a more acurate description of what the package actually does than TargetedEstimation.jl which is why I renamed it.",

      "body": "I see… that makes sense. By today's standards, I'm not sure if we'd still merge a `TMLE.jl` package. As the number of packages in General has grown since 2021, we've tended to get stricter about package naming. But `TMLE.jl` exists, which in my book makes it fair game for \"addon\" packages using it as part of their name. Also, `CLI` is a ubiquitous abbreviation that, I think, is fine for package names. With that in mind, I would *strongly* prefer going back to https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/113582 and naming this package `TMLECLI.jl`. The `TMLE` gives the context for the package, and it should remain in the original uppercase spelling. Yes, that makes the package fail the automatic checks, and it will have to be merged manually. But it's a better name than `TmleCLI`, and I would strongly support a manual merge (unfortunately I don't have permissions to merge myself). Changing upper/lower-case in a package name simply to make the automatic checks happy is never a good idea.\r\n\r\nAlternatively: Does this have to be an independent package? It might be better to make it a sub-package of `TMLE`, which would be loaded as `using TMLE.CLI`.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear: this is my opinion, but you have the last word on this. I can unblock the merge if you want me to.",

This is done in `TMLECLI.jl` as well as providing higher level routines that can be used either from Julia itself or as a standalone app. So the `TMLE.CLI` wouldn't work in this case I think.\r\n\r\nI agree with your point and will revert to `TMLECLI.jl`!",
