      "body": "Hi @bgctw, and thank you for contributing to the ecosystem!\r\nI am not sure this package really needs to be registered. Based on the docs, it mostly contains three small and very different utilities, which suggests that it is a collection of utilities for your projects, not necessarily for the community at large.\r\nIf you want to use it in your open science endeavors (which I support!), maybe a [local registry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl) would be an option? Alternately, you can try to contribute these utilities to the relevant packages and see what they think?\r\n\r\nPS: This comment will pause the registration for now. Anyone can do that, I don't have any registry maintainer privileges.",

As I understood the suggested local registry, its intended for \"local\" work. However, for reproducible science, I would need a publicly accessible Registry. Do you know of such a registry hosted by an institution that can provide such packages that are not suitable for General?",
