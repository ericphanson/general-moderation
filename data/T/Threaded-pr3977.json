Perhaps something a bit more descriptive `ThreadedReductions` or `ThreadedMapReduce`?",

      "body": "I've added the `[compat]` section for julia (no dependencies).\r\n\r\nI agree thet the name is a bit too generic. Originally, I called the package `ThreadedMap`, but over the time as I added more functions the name was less and less fitting. I thought about something like `ThreadedFunctions` but that seemed too general. `ThreadedMapReduce` on the other hand seems unfitting because there are more functions than just the two... (And I can see more yet to come). So far, I've been mainly thinking about [functions on iterable collections](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.2/base/collections/#Iterable-Collections-1), so maybe something like `ThreadedIterables`?",
