Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- There is no compat entry for `julia`.\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: CSV, DataFrames, Plots, YAML\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

  "body": "- Registering package: TrainRun\n- Repository: https://github.com/railtoolkit/TrainRun.jl\n- Created by: @kaat0\n- Version: v0.8.0\n- Commit: 25959f730233eb1003200047b0f68c2e0b709594\n- Git reference: HEAD\n- Description: TrainRun.jl will take a user-defined train and a path as an input for a train run calculation. It can calculate the train run as a time-efficient or energy-efficient operation mode. The results can then be used within the Julia environment.\n- Release notes:\n<!-- BEGIN RELEASE NOTES -->\n> Initial release: TrainRun.jl is a step towards open science and open data in railway engineering. Its modular design offers the possibility to serve as a basis for future optimization and development. TrainRun.jl is suitable for qualitative calculations to compare different trains, and it is publicly available, and we invite others to collaborate.\n<!-- END RELEASE NOTES -->",
