Registration of 0.1.0 was successful. \r\n\r\nEDIT:  My intention was to have 0.1.1 as soon as 0.1.0 is registered, but this got identified with the open request to have the initial registration of 0.1.1. Meanwhile I was able to register 0.2.0 (indeed more than a patch release), so this PR can be safely abandoned.\r\n",
