      "body": "Hello,\n\nI was thinking the same thing. The problem lies with we are using Pluto and this package requires instruments to be added to a YAML file (along with us adding other instruments not defined). But Pluto creates its own environment and wont pull from a YAML in the working directory (I have tried using InstrumentConfig). I can deactivate this environment but it defeats the purpose of being able to share Pluto notebooks easily to others.\n\nIf you have any suggestions I'm more than welcome to them. (Also the code will follow a similar path to theirs so we will be adding instruments and their functions that theoretically someone else can use.)\n\nBest,\nCharles\n________________________________\nFrom: Dilum Aluthge ***@***.***>\nSent: Monday, May 30, 2022 5:25:08 PM\nTo: JuliaRegistries/General ***@***.***>\nCc: Charles Wise ***@***.***>; Mention ***@***.***>\nSubject: Re: [JuliaRegistries/General] New package: TcpControl v0.1.0 (PR #61348)\n\nWARNING: This email originated from a non-WCU email account.
