Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 10 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Tau. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  2. Similar to Tar. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to Why. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to Org. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  5. Similar to TCX.

However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I think \"Try\" is the best word describing the philosophy behind this package. For example, quoting the first paragraph in a discussion section [Focus on *actions*; not the types](https://github.com/tkf/Try.jl#focus-on-actions-not-the-types):\r\n\r\n> Try.jl aims at providing generic tools for composing failable procedures.  This emphasis on performing *actions* that can fail contrasts with other [similar Julia packages](https://github.com/tkf/Try.jl#similar-packages) focusing on types and is reflected in the name of the package: *Try*.  This is an important guideline on designing APIs for dynamic programming languages like Julia in which high-level code should be expressible without managing types.\r\n\r\nGiven that there are some broader interests in this type of error handling  https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/discussions/43773, I'm also willing to hand this over to a larger organization once this package is sufficiently matured and tested in the wild (e.g., to JuliaLang if `Base` needs to use something like this).\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
