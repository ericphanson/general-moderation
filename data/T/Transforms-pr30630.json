You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

But, you don't always have autocomplete, and \"Engineering\" and \"Transformations\" could sound redundant (even though it's not meant to).\r\n\r\nIf we're going to change it, for me it has to say something about what is being transformed. I'll rule out `Data*` (too common) and `FeatureEngineering` (internal clash). Besides, I'm not sure it would do justice to something as general as `FeatureEngineering` - so many kinds of operations fall under that term (technically, `FeatureTransforms` could be even more general, but I mean the terminology used in practice).\r\n\r\n`Transforms` vs. `Transformations`, no strong opinion - `Transform` as a noun seems less commonly accepted in dictionaries, but common enough in technical fields.",
