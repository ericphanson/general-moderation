Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- There is no compat entry for `julia`.\n- Package name similar to 12 existing packages.\n  <details>\n  <summary>Similar package names</summary>\n\n  1. Similar to Ant. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 2.46 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to Git.

However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Additionally, it does not clash with any other package name and the only issue that seems to be present is that it is too short.\r\nIf that is indeed the case, I can change it to `Output.jl`, although I am not sure why it would be necessary.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

      "body": "Nice little package! I'm no decision maker on these things, but for what it's worth, I think the name is fine and support it.\r\n\r\nIf it's decided that this package name isn't acceptable for some reason, can I suggest the names \"Showln.jl\" and `@showln`? It's not a perfect name because the analogy between this and `@show` is not quite the same as the analogy between `print` and `println`. On the other hand, I think this is more faithful to the `show` function than `@show` itself is, so 🤷. \r\n\r\nI've had a `@showln` in my startup.jl for a long time now that basically does this, and I'd be glad to replace it with a package. \r\n[noblock]",
