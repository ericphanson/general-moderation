      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) which are not met ❌\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n\n## 3. *Needs action*: here's what to do next\n\n1. Please try to update your package to conform to these guidelines. The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\n2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\n\nIf you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [public Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) for better visibility.\n\n## 4. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Is this using a custom (broken) CSS file?\r\n\r\nIn theory, the bot could be made happy by changing the spelling to `OwensFEA`, but that might have the smell of a (discouraged) [\"personal package\"](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#should-i-register-my-package-now), and more importantly: What is \"FEA\"? Generally speaking, acronyms that are not widely known should be avoided in package names.",

      "body": "Thanks @goerz!  This is part of the Sandia National Labs OWENS.jl toolkit (Offshore Wind Energy Simulator), so it isn't a personal package.  I'm hopeful to register this and several others like it in the coming weeks, so it will be good to address these issues now.   My IP folks required me to label all of the packages with the OWENS name, but we might be able to change them if required. \r\n\r\n- OWENS.jl a generalized aero-servo-hydro-elastic wind turbine or hydrokinetic turbine simulator\r\n- OWENSAero.jl very similar to CCBlade.jl but for vertical axis wind turbines as opposed to horizontal axis turbines\r\n- OWENSFEA.jl generalized multi-body beam finite analysis very similar to GXBeam.jl but using a different beam model\r\n- OWENSOpenFASTWrappers.jl a wrapper to the OpenFAST fortran libraries for floating platforms and wind turbine aerodynamics, which we're nearly complete porting the binary creation over to yggdrasil/builarybuilder\r\n- OWENSPreComp.jl generalized classical laminate theory sectional property generator to go from blade shapes and thicknesses to values usable by the finite element emthods, translated from the fortran PreComp, which is similar to VABS.\r\n\r\nApologies on the docs not building correctly, I'll get that fixed soon.",
