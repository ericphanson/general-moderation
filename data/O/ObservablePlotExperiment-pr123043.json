      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "> this library will not be super well maintained! There will probably not be any docs, tests or any guarantees of that kind\r\n\r\nThat's a little at odds with what we normally require for registrations in General. The minimum requirement is usually that it's sufficiently well-documented so that someone can figure out how to start using it from the README or a linked documentation. That doesn't seem to be the case here.\r\n\r\nIf you're intending to follow semantic versioning, that note would also definitely be at odds with tagging as `v1.0`. The `v1.0` tag indicates that you're going to be making SemVer compatibility promises, i.e., that the package has a stable API. In my mind, \"stable API\" implies a complete documentation, and probably also testing with pretty good coverage.\r\n\r\nI appreciate wanting to share some experimental package with a wider audience, but I'm not sure that this is suitable for registration in General. Maybe with a bit more documentation and as a v0.1 package?",
