What kind of time frame did you have in mind for building up some documentation?\r\n\r\nIt will of course be an ongoing process, but regarding ImageAnnotations and dependent packages:\r\n* ONNXRuntimeImageAnnotators: I think documentation as of now is on par with code, and tests, so it should just be a natural requirement for each change going forward.\r\n* FiftyOneImageAnnotations (#88970): Under-documented as of now, but also the very elaborate upstream [FiftyOne Documentation](https://docs.voxel51.com) applies - pretty much 1-1. It will not be a goal to re-do the FiftyOne documentation in its entirety. There should be documentation of common use cases in Julia - and documentation of the integration with the ImageAnnotations package. \r\n* ImageAnnotationsIO (#88272): Slightly under-documented - will add/improve documentation with each change going forward. It's also under-tested.\r\n\r\nRegarding a timeline - it's a bit hard to say, as these packages are maintained partially within our day jobs @ IHP Systems, and partially (mostly, really) in my spare time. Tim's thread on Discourse on timelines in open source applies: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/why-open-source-timelines-roadmaps-dont-work/99518\r\n\r\nThese packages are however supporting our daily job @ IHP Systems and so will receive a significant effort wrt. correctness and features, but also wrt. documentation.\r\n\r\nThe practice @ IHP Systems has been for \"self-documenting code\" - as documentation often can get out of sync. It's of course much less of a problem in Julia with doctests, but yeah we're used to working with code **with** tests - *without* documentation. But the aim is to change that - while also highlighting (in house) the nice documentation features of the Julia ecosystem.\r\n\r\nSo no documentation updates tomorrow, but I hope the speediness of the README updates were an indication of the speed with which documentation will be added :-)\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
