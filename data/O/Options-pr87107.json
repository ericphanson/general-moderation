      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to Optionals. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Thank you for your feedback. I apologize for the lack of clarity in the package description. Options.jl is a package that brings the concept of optional values, similar to Rust's Option type, to Julia. It provides a set of comprehensive types and functions, including `Some(data)` and `None`, for working with optional values. With `Options.jl`, you can write more concise and reliable code by simplifying the handling of optional values. Additionally, the package offers functions for transforming, mapping, and chaining operations on Option types. I will take your suggestion into consideration and work on providing more specific documentation to better communicate the package's functionality and purpose to users.",

How different is it from the [built-in `Some`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Base.Some)?\r\n\r\nCould I suggest renaming the package to `OptionalValues.jl`? Package names are in short supply in Julia since they all share the same namespace, so the more specific the better. At first glance yours made me think it was about setting options (parameters), not for dealing with optional values.",
