The module contains one line:\r\n```\r\n# Write your package code here.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also a good name that I'm not sure should be taken by not yet working code. On the other hand there's also code there for 4 other languages (seemingly well developed, though all 4 files on smaller side), and I'm not sure what to do for multi-language packages. [If this is an important package for other languages, do we want to reserve a/this name here? Is there a policy for/against that?] And keep same name, even though we usually start with a capital letter? It would be bad to register later upper-case OpenInterfaces.jl (for other stuff), while I'm not sure such \"conflicts\" would automerge.\r\n\r\nThere IS though a license file, OSI-approved it seems (or such language). I guess that's important for one-line (comment) code. :)\r\n",
