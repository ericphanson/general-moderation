Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Repo URL does not end with /name.jl.git, where name is the package name\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

I looked at Survival.jl it looked like it would have required a significant re-factoring to accomodate some features I consider necessary in applied work (e.g. preferred methods to handle tied event times via the Efron partial likelihood, observation weights, residuals, and handling of left truncation) of the main package functions. \r\n\r\n[AcceleratedFailure.jl](https://github.com/piever/AcceleratedFailure.jl) that is being ported into Survival.jl, but it has the same limitations. [EventHistory.jl](https://github.com/kkholst/EventHistory.jl) hasn't been updated in 5 years and lacks Efron's partial likelihood. [SurvivalAnalysis.jl](https://github.com/vollmersj/SurvivalAnalysis.jl) looks like it's not being updated and is missing a lot of basic functionality (e.g. Cox models)\r\n",
