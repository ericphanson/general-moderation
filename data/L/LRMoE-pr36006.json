Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to RoME. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Although it is similar to an existing package (RMoE, **Ro**bot **M**otion **E**stimate), they are doing quite different stuff, so I think it is unlikely that users would confuse these two.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a paper accompanying this package has already been published (see [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/annals-of-actuarial-science/article/abs/lrmoejl-a-software-package-for-insurance-loss-modelling-using-mixture-of-experts-regression-model/18B8F5C17733C4DBAF2F921E08372DD8)). Changing its name would cause a lot of inconvenience for existing users.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!",
