      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 3 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Luxor. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 2.47 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to Muon. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to Kucoin. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I respectfully ask to accept the name Lucon.jl as the package name.  \r\n\r\nThe module implements an optimizer for functions which map a unitary matrix onto a real number (the loss). A name like \"LossOptimizer\" would meet the package naming guidelines, but it would be grossly inaccurate since loss optimization is a huge field in science and the module is meant to optimize only a subset of these problems.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, I would have to use a name like \"RealValuedFunctionOptimizationUnderUnitaryConstraint\". This is, to say the least, very long, clumsy and unreadable.\r\n\r\nThe name Lucon stands for **L**oss optimization under **U**nitary **CON**straint. It is not jargon but simply an invention, and can fluently be pronounced as \"loo-kon\".\r\n\r\nSince it will be part of a new software package for materials science in Julia, which will interface with the globally known [VASP code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Ab_initio_Simulation_Package), it is likely to be recognized and used in the scientific community.",
