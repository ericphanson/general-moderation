I was not aware of [FlexyMaps.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAPlavin/FlexiMaps.jl) although, sometime ago, I had a look at the 2 others and decided that they could not really meet my needs. I wanted a lightweight package to implement lazy maps (of arrays or collections) for my under development new version of [LazyAlgebra](https://github.com/emmt/LazyAlgebra.jl/tree/devel), one requirement is to be able to make lazy mappings of arrays work on CPUs as well as on GPUs.\r\n\r\nBut you are right, I have to make sure of this. For example, I've just looked again and `BroadcastArray(f, A)` in [LazyArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/LazyArrays.jl) is in fact close to `lazymap(f, A)` in [LazyMaps](https://github.com/emmt/LazyMaps.jl) and shows impressive preformances.\r\n\r\nIn the comming days I will investigate these other possibilities...",

      "body": "> I wonder how it compares to `mapview(f, A)` from FlexiMaps.jl? Would be nice to have such a comparison in the README (or make a PR if there's some minor thing missing :) ).\r\n\r\nI takes a while but I made a comparison of the different existing possibilities. `mapview(f,A)` from [`FlexiMaps`](https://github.com/JuliaAPlavin/FlexiMaps.jl) is indeed very similar to `lazymap(f, A)` and has nice additional features (dictionaries, etc.). The results of my tests (and benchmarks) are summarized at the end of this [`README.md`](https://github.com/emmt/LazyMaps.jl/blob/main/README.md).\r\n\r\nHowever, with `FlexiMaps`, there is no equivalent to `lazymap(T, f, A)` to specify an element type for the mapped view and directly build a `FlexiMaps.MappedArray` with a given element type yields an abstract array whose `eltype` is not the type of the result returned by `getindex` while `lazymap` takes care of converting this result correctly. Among the other tested packages, only `BroadcastArray{T}(f, A)` using [`LazyArrays`](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/LazyArrays.jl) provide.\r\n\r\nAlso, in `FlexiMaps`, there is no shortcut to build a read-only view when the inverse function is known. This is simply done by `lazymap(f,A,throw)` in `LazyMaps`. \r\n\r\nFinally, `FlexiMaps` has currently a compat bound of Julia ≥ 1.10 which I would like to relax because I have real-time  software running on a solar telescope that currently works on an older Julia version and I do not want to break it. \r\n\r\nI'd be happy to make a PR to add these features in `FlexiMaps` but the element type issue is quite a breaking change, it implies that for `B = mapview(T, f, A)`, the expression `B[i]` is evaluated as `convert(T, f(A[i]))::T` or something similar (this changes nothing to evaluate `B[i] = x`). @aplavin What do you think?

Seems quite concise for me :)\r\n\r\n> FlexiMaps has currently a compat bound of Julia ≥ 1.10 which I would like to relax\r\n\r\nIt supported Julia 1.6+ until FlexiMaps@0.1.15. Then I bumped Julia compat indeed, old Julia versions aren't officially supported now anyway.\r\nBut I'm definitely open to PRs that expand Julia/package compat, that's not a fundamental issue.",
