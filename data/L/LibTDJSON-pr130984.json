I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Bottom line is that it's pretty much up to you 😉 (or, you could ask on Slack/Discourse).\r\n\r\nThe potential overlap with `TelegramClient` is probably a more substantial point. Especially with the generally encouraged \"descriptive\" package naming scheme resulting in what should be \"authoritative\" packages, I would always push for contributing to an existing package over registering an alternative solution, from a community perspective. But I'm also not personally invested, so that's probably something you should work out with @aplavin ",

If that's the case, I would really welcome any input (including PRs) to add missing functionality.\r\nLooking at LibTDJSON.jl source (https://github.com/bhftbootcamp/LibTDJSON.jl/blob/master/src/LibTDJSON.jl), I see functions that just wrap ccalls – it's very easy to add these to TelegramClient.jl if needed.\r\nNote that TelegramClient.jl already has some low-level api functions, see eg https://github.com/JuliaAPlavin/TelegramClient.jl/blob/master/src/api_raw.jl.\r\n\r\nStill, of course you can decide that LibTDJSON.jl needs to be a separate package. In that case it's common and recommended to at least add some mention and comparison with existing packages to the README – in this case, TelegramClient.jl that has been available for years.",
