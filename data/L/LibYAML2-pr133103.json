      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) which are not met ❌\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to LibYAML. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1.\n\n## 3. *Needs action*: here's what to do next\n\n1. Please try to update your package to conform to these guidelines. The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\n2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\n\nIf you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [public Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) for better visibility.\n\n## 4. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Despite my misgivings in https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/133076#issuecomment-2981114018, I agree with @ChrisRackauckas in https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/133076#issuecomment-2981625844 that this should _replace_ the existing `LibYAML`. The idea of the `General` registry is very much that of a shared community resource, which comes with the recommendation for very general and descriptive package names (which then should be the \"canonical\" package for its domain), and the idea that when packages become unmaintained, they can be transferred to one of the established Julia organizations and assigned a new maintainer. For `LibYAML` that is exactly what happened: `LibYAML` was transferred to `JuliaData` so that the it can be assigned a new maintainer, in this case potentially @gryumov or @kbarsegian, who can then integrate the code from https://github.com/bhftbootcamp/LibYAML2.jl and release it as a new breaking version.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, based on the communication here and in the earlier threads surrounding this new `LibYAML` version, as well as similar experiences with half a dozen previous registrations, I'm not sure that there is an alignment between this community-managed aspect of packages in the General registry and the way BHFT Bootcamp handles the development of Julia packages. That is completely fine, and why the [guidelines for General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#should-i-register-my-package-now) recommend a local registry for \"packages that are only useful for a closed group (like a research group or a company)\". Hence my recommendation, or personal preference, for BHFT Bootcamp to keep their entire ecosystem in the dedicated registry at https://github.com/bhftbootcamp/Green. However, the fact is that [Serde.jl](https://github.com/bhftbootcamp/Serde.jl) (and some other BHFT Bootcamp packages) _are_ in General, which means that if `Serde` wants to use this new `LibYAML` implementation (which it is absolutely entitled to do), that leaves two options:\r\n\r\n* Work within the community to maintain the new code as part of the existing `LibYAML`, within the `JuliaData` organization\r\n* Add the new `LibYAML` implementation as a submodule to `Serde`\r\n\r\nI don't think the community interests are really compatible with having a separate `LibYAML2` when the original `LibYAML` can still continue. But I'm also okay with others (the registry maintainers) taking a different view on this, and merging `LibYAML2`.",
