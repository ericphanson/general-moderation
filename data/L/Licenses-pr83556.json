      "body": "> How about `SoftwareLicenses.jl` or `ContentLicenses.jl`?\r\n\r\nYeah we talked about `SoftwareLicenses` in the Discourse post, that title feels a bit misleading to me because this package also pulls licenses for other forms of content, like writing and visual media with Creative Commons licenses. \r\n\r\nFor `ContentLicenses`, I feel the word `Content` doesn't add much. But what about `CommonLicenses` — all of the licenses provided by this package are \"standard\" or \"common\", so a word like that adds something to the meaning of the package name imo. \r\n\r\nI am totally okay with merging `Licenses.jl`, but I wanted to give maintainers and the general community the opportunity to veto `Licenses.jl`. I'm going to change the package name to `CommonLicenses.jl`. If there are no objections, could you please add `[noblock]` to your comment @DilumAluthge?",
