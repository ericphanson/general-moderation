In this case, the package is copied (not moved) to an organization with a new maintainer, and the registry is changed to point to this new repository.

      "body": "I might be a little fuzzy on the details myself. The first step would definitely be to add @sadit to the organization.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, let @sadit move the repo to the org. From my experience, when a non-owner creates/moves a repo to an org, they don't automatically have full maintainer permissions to set up (for setting up CI/access to repo secrets, etc), so @quinnj (as an owner, presumably), should go into the settings of the repo and give @sadi admin access.\r\n\r\nThere might also be some confusion with Github treating forks as special, which might affect CI settings. I think my recommendation would be is to create a new repository for `LevelDB2` (so that Github doesn't see any connection to the original `LevelDB`), and then push the current branch to that repo.\r\n\r\nSo, I think what I would do if I was @quinnj:\r\n\r\n* Invite @sadit to the `JuliaDatabases` org\r\n* Create a new (empty) repo `JuliaDatabases/LevelDB2`\r\n* Give @sadit full Admin access to that specific repo\r\n* Let @sadit push the current branch to the repo and set up CI/etc.\r\n* Have @sadit trigger a new registration for `JuliaDatabases/LevelDB2`\r\n\r\nBut maybe someone on Slack has more expertise in this and can give better instructions. I'll ask.\r\n\r\nI'm making this comment blocking because if the repo is moved, it'll need a new registration, and I'll close this PR in favor of whatever the new PR will be.",
