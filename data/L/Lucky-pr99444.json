Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: Rocket\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to Lucon. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

That might be fine, but the project also does not have any documentation or even a description of what the purpose of the package is.

Without that, the package cannot be used by others and thus [is not ready for General yet](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General#should-i-register-my-package-now)",

With \"nice\" names like `Lucky`, I would tend to put a little bit more scrutiny on the package. I'd feel much better if it's a package that has some kind of institutional (or commercial) backing that would ensure its longer-term maintenance. With personal, \"one-off\" packages, there's a much greater risk of the package becoming unmaintained. That's fine for `MySpecificFeatureTradingPackage`, but not so much with a name like `Lucky` that maybe some bigger project could use in the future. Can you comment on how you see the maintenance status of this package in the longer term?\r\n\r\nIn any case, this still needs a manual merge because of the name similarity flag, so it's not up to me (I don't have merge permissions on General). After the three-day waiting period, you'll have to get the attention of a registry maintainer on Slack.",

(My package integrates https://github.com/JuliaQuant/MarketData.jl as a data source)\r\n\r\nQuantFi people are R, Matlab, or Python people who'd love a bridge to the world of Julia math libraries (probabilities, statistics, solvers, MLs, etc.), but that also requires a way to get out of the lab and into production. That's what this package proposes to do. \r\n\r\nThis package also integrates with another package I am releasing (https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/99427 ).\r\n\r\nIn any case, my funky package name doesn't seem to collide with any serious institution or scientific field does it? (Not as if I called it Thermodynamics.jl :) ) \r\n\r\nWhatever you decide, I've been on GitHub for about 12 years now. Not planning on going away anytime soon. :)",
