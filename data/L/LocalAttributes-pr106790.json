The concept of local attributes applies not only to seismic applications, but that is where it started. We can treat any signal using our package, not only seismic signals. We are doing a conjugate gradient with shaping regularization.  Would it be okay if I change the package name from LocalSeismicAtrributes to LocalAttributes? (I will make the description more robust in the new PR)",
