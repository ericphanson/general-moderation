      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to Survival. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

It generalizes the capabilities to much more realistic settings for survival data analysis and so provides unique capabilities for survival analysis in Julia. The confusion between \"LSurvival\" and \"Survival\" seems unlikely and the \"L\" emphasizes functionality for \"Left truncation,\" but \"LeftTruncationSurvival\" or simpler iterations are cumbersome and suggest limited utility.",

      "body": " [noblock] I have already requested this to be manually merged via the recommended slack channel  (https://julialang.slack.com/archives/C6M4DQA5P/p1694448732309659) but have received no response via slack nor any apparent action on github. This package now includes parametric, non-parametric, and semi-parametric approaches to survival analysis that allow left truncation and right censoring and thus is more comprehensive and up-to-date than any of the alternative packages that were mentioned in this thread: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/91190#issuecomment-1714135142\r\n\r\nThe only other package that seems to handle left truncation is https://github.com/kkholst/EventHistory.jl, which was last updated 6 years ago. \r\nThe only response I recieved via my previous attempt at registering the module was that I should be updating the other modules, but at this point the LSurvival module has surpassed the capabilities of anything existing, so it would require unnecessarily re-duplicating my own efforts on other modules. The only usable survival analysis module in the general registry that I'm aware of is Survival.jl from juliastats, which cannot be easily modified via pull requests to incorporate left truncation because the estimation algorithms in that module rely on shortcuts that only work if left truncation is not allowed. Trying to adapt that module to be as general as LSurvival.jl would require a complete refactorization of that module. I'm happy for someone from JuliaStats to take what I've done and incorporate it into Survival.jl, but I am not in a position to do that myself. Survival.jl is fast, but it isn't suited for very many applied problems, which is why I wrote LSurvival.jl. The functions in LSurvival.jl have been validated, where possible, against the `survival` package in R, which is the gold standard in applied survival analysis.\r\n\r\n",
