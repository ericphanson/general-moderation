Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to LibPSF. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.

      "body": "I have no fundamental objections to this package, but the name `LibSSH` implies a certain level of authoritativeness. Generally, I would put packages with a general name like that under a little bit more scrutiny, especially for something as high-profile as SSH. Looking at the documentation, this package already seems to be in pretty good shape, and to have the potential of living up to the expectations of being an \"authoritative\" package.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that I might be concerned about is having this package registered under a personal account. I'd feel much better if this was hosted by an existing organization with multiple owners (and owners that are close to the core Julia development team). [JuliaCrypto](https://github.com/JuliaCrypto) or [JuliaWeb](https://github.com/JuliaWeb) would both seem suitable. This would help in ensuring that the package does not become unmaintained, and lend a certain level of trust. Given how critical SSH is to the security of the internet, I'd be very cautious about adding an SSH implementation from an \"unknown\" source to any project.\r\n\r\nThis is not a strong objection, and certainly not a blocker to merging, since looking up @JamesWrigley's background would quickly pass my \"trustworthiness\" meter, but still.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

First, they have to add you to the organization as a member. Then, you have to transfer the repo to that organization (in the \"danger zone\" of your repo settings). And lastly, they have to give you back admin permissions just on that particular repo (you'd think the transfer would keep you as an admin, but it doesn't). Once you have your admin-status back for the repo, there shouldn't really be any difference for you compared to when it was hosted under your personal account. You'll still be the maintainer, and you can commit to it, manage PRs, make releases, etc., as you wish. The only difference is that if you get hit by a bus, or you suddenly get blackmailed into adding a backdoor into the code, the org admins could step in and give other people maintainer access as well.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
