      "body": "So eht-imaging was absolutely excellent advertising since it is just one of several imaging packages used by the EHT. \r\nIn terms of renaming Comrade, I am open to it, but the algorithms we use in Comrade are very different from those in eht-imaging. I don't really want Comrade to be viewed as eht-imaging but in Julia it is substantially more than that. \r\nWith that being said I do like Pyehtim.jl so I'll switch the package name to that. \r\n\r\nQuick question @Moelf do I need to close this and submit a new package PR?\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
