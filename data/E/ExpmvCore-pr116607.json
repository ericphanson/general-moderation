I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

So, I'd want to hold off on merging this while you explore your options for contributing to the existing package.\r\n\r\n> I would also prefer that whether my code is available publicly not depend on whether I want to incorporate my code into a larger package.\r\n\r\nYour code does not have to be registered in `General` for it to be \"public\". Your collaborators can [install the package directly from GitHub](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/managing-packages/#Adding-unregistered-packages) with\r\n\r\n```\r\n] add https://github.com/jecs/StaticExpmv.jl\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, you can register it in another registry, i.e., set up a [LocalRegistry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl), to make it easier to work with the package if it is a dependency for other (unregistered) packages currently under development.\r\n\r\n[Edit: that would install `StaticExpmv`, not the sub-package `ExpmvCore`. Sub-packages make this a little more complicated, and I'd have to figure out what the correct invocation of `Pkg` is]",

I don't think this has come up before, but we'd have to think a bit about whether it makes sense / is okay for a sub-package to be registered when the parent package is unregistered.\r\n\r\nThere's also that if the parent package is named `StaticExpmv`, should be the sub-package be `StaticExpmvCore`? There is already https://github.com/marcusps/ExpmV.jl (albeit unregistered), so @marcusps would have a claim on the name `ExpmVCore`.\r\n\r\nLastly, even for sub-packages, there has to be an independent README (in https://github.com/jecs/StaticExpmv.jl/tree/master/ExpmvCore) that explains the context and the relationship to the parent package, and possibly points to more complete documentation for the functionality implemented by the sub-package.",

The sub-package should definitely be `StaticExpmvCore`, then, however.\r\n\r\n> Registering the main package requires registering the subpackage. \r\n\r\nIt would be possible (and even preferable, albeit a little more difficult) to manually prepare a PR that registers both `StaticExpmv` and `StaticExpmvCore` at the same time. I think to prepare such PRs, you also use the [LocalRegistry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl) package. Not 100% sure, it might be worth searching/asking on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org) about the best workflow.\r\n\r\nI'm not fundamentally opposed to having an independent `StaticExpmv`, if it specifically exploits properties of `StaticMatrix` in a way that does not fit into the philosophy of `ExponentialUtilities`. The relationship to `ExponentialUtilities` should definitely be clarified before the registration, though. I suppose @ChrisRackauckas directly is the person maintaining `ExponentialUtilities`",
