The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: Calculus, Dierckx, DifferentialEquations, LsqFit, Optim, Parameters, Plots, PyCall, PyPlot, SymPy, julia\n- I was not able to install the package (i.e. `Pkg.add(\"EstimHill\")` failed). See the CI logs for details.\n- I was not able to load the package (i.e. `import EstimHill` failed). See the CI logs for details.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.
