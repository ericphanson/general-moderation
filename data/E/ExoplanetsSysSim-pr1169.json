      "body": "> It would be good to add some compat constraints, at least on Julia itself.\r\n\r\nFair point.  I pushed a new commit to master with versions base on what I've tested it with (at least for  packages not part of the basic Julia install, which I'm guessing follow the julia release).  \r\n\r\nThis is my first time dealing with Registrator, and I don't see instructions for what to do after making a suggested change that didn't trigger automatic error messages.  Should I do nothing and let things automatically run their course?  \r\nOr should I add a \"<Shift2>JuliaRegistrator register\" comment to the new commit with those changes, and do something to close out this one?\r\n\r\nThanks",
