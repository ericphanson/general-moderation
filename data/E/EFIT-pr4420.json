      "body": "Considering this package does not do Equilibrium Fitting I think that would be a poor choice . EFIT is a separate code that I do not develop. The ultimate goal of this package is to be an interface for running EFIT but currently all it can do is read EFIT's output file which is useful by itself. \r\n\r\nSince this package is wrapping a seperate code I believe the package name is appropriate as per the [naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1)\r\n```\r\n6. Packages that wrap external libraries or programs should be named after those libraries or programs.\r\n\r\nCPLEX.jl wraps the CPLEX library, which can be identified easily in a web search.\r\nMATLAB.jl provides an interface to call the MATLAB engine from within Julia.\r\n```",
