      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Version number is not allowed to contain prerelease data\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: CSV, DSP, EDF, FFTW, Plots\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "> Version number is not allowed to contain prerelease data\r\n\r\nYou have to set the `version` in the `Project.toml` of your package to `0.1.0` (or whatever version you want, but, `0.1.0` would be the usual choice for an initial registration). You cannot have `-DEV` in your `version.`\r\n\r\n> The following dependencies do not have a [compat] entry\r\n\r\nIn your [`Project.toml`](https://github.com/slopezpereyra/EEGToolkit.jl/blob/main/Project.toml), for every package that is listed in the `[deps]` section, there must also be an entry in the `[compat]` section, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\n[compat]\r\nDSP = \"0.7\"\r\nEDF = \"0.7\"\r\nFFTW = \"1.8\"\r\nPlots = \"1.40\"\r\njulia = \"1.6\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n> How can I fix this?\r\n\r\nModify your `Project.toml`, commit, and then re-register. Because the version number has to change, this will open a new registration pull request, and we'll close this one.",
