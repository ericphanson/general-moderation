Simply use the `Manifest.toml` file to specify the forks and branches that you want to use, and then check your `Manifest.toml` file into source control. (You will need to make sure that you do not have any entries in your `.gitignore` file that match `Manifest.toml`.)\r\n\r\nFor example, you can take a look at what Keno has done with the manifest for his unregistered package [`ToyFHE.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ToyFHE.jl):\r\n- Project file: https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ToyFHE.jl/blob/70acf5d5c14fc9249091e7cd07b57a0123ff8b7f/Project.toml\r\n- Manifest file: https://github.com/JuliaComputing/ToyFHE.jl/blob/70acf5d5c14fc9249091e7cd07b57a0123ff8b7f/Manifest.toml\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the manifest file, Keno has forked several of the repos, and `ToyFHE.jl` uses Keno's forks instead of the upstream repos. As one example, instead of using the upstream `BitIntegers.jl` repo (https://github.com/rfourquet/BitIntegers.jl), the manifest uses the `kf/div` branch inside Keno's fork (https://github.com/Keno/BitIntegers.jl).\r\n\r\nOf course, you should not create or edit `Manifest.toml` files by hand. So doing something like `]add https://github.com/Keno/BitIntegers.jl#kf/div` in the `Pkg` REPL mode is how you tell `Pkg` to use your fork and your branch.",

So, for example, if your package supports Julia 1.0 and later, you might use each different version of Julia to generate a different `Manifest.toml` file as follows:\r\n- Julia 1.0 -> `Manifest.1.0.toml` \r\n- Julia 1.1 -> `Manifest.1.1.toml` \r\n- Julia 1.2 -> `Manifest.1.2.toml` \r\n- Julia 1.3 -> `Manifest.1.3.toml` \r\n\r\nYou would check in all of those manifest files (`Manifest.1.0.toml`, `Manifest.1.1.toml` , `Manifest.1.2.toml`, and `Manifest.1.3.toml`) into source control.\r\n\r\nAnd then, if you want to e.g. load your package on Julia 1.2, you would do this:\r\n```bash\r\ncp Manifest.1.2.toml Manifest.toml\r\n```\r\nAnd then you would instantiate the manifest.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: There are some people that agree with this approach, and some people that disagree. I don't know if we should necessarily encourage or advocate for this approach. But we should at minimum allow it and have support for it.",
