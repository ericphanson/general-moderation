There are many \"exact solutions\" in science, so that name by itself is almost completely non-descriptive. At the very least, `ExactFieldSolutions` or `Exact2DFieldSolutions`, but there might be a better name that really captures the scope of the package.",

      "body": "Thanks a lot for the suggestion! I think renaming to `ExactFieldSolutions` is a very good idea, hence I applied this change. Some solutions are 3D and some might be 1D, so I would like not to reflect dimensionality in the package name. So far most solutions are for Poisson and mechanical problems but other physics are more than welcome. I will now try to re-register, thanks again! Should I close this PR and start a new one with the new name?",
