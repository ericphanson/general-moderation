It just means that your pull request will require manual review by a human.\n\n> These guidelines are intended not as requirements for packages but as very conservative guidelines, which, if your new package or new version of a package meets them, it may be automatically merged.\n\n---\nOn a separate note, I see that you are registering a release with a version number of the form `v0.X.Y`.\n\nDoes your package have a stable public API? If so, then it's time for you to register version `v1.0.0` of your package. (This is not a requirement. It's just a recommendation.)\n\nIf your package does not yet have a stable public API, then of course you are not yet ready to release version `v1.0.0`.\n\n---\n[noblock]",
