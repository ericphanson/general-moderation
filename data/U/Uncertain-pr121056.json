      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Oh, sorry, I didn't notice your comment and left for a short vacation :) Only noticed after coming back and trying to register a new version of `Uncertain` and a new version of a package that depends on it now (https://github.com/JuliaAPlavin/VLBIData.jl/commit/00000000f737bff97d86bc1259d7b119f6b23857#commitcomment-150406382).\r\n\r\nI thought that names longer than 5 characters are fine here, and this one is definitely longer (and isn't an abbreviation/trademark/similar to another name/...). I'm open to a short prefix like\r\n`AUncertain`, `APUncertain`... Though `APlavinUncertain` would be too long for my taste.\r\nI like how the package name plays nicely with the type defined there, ie `Uncertain.Value`, and would like to keep that part.",
