Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Lowercase package name updatejulia contains the string \"julia\".\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Avoid using Julia in your package name or prefixing it with Ju.\r\n>\r\n>  - It is usually clear from context and to your users that the package is a Julia package.\r\n>  - Package names already have a .jl extension, which communicates to users that Package.jl is a Julia package.\r\n>  - Having Julia in the name can imply that the package is connected to, or endorsed by, contributors to the Julia language itself.\r\n> 4. Err on the side of clarity, even if clarity seems long-winded to you.\r\n\r\nThis package is for updating (or managing) the version(s) of the julia programming language installed on a user's system.
