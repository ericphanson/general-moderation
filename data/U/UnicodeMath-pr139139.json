      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I'm not sure I understand the scope of this package, or how it relates to the `unicode-math` LaTeX package. My understanding of that LaTeX package is that it allows to use e.g. `α` in an equation inside a `.tex` file instead of the normal `\\alpha`. That is not something that has an obvious Julia-equivalent. Does this package simply convert between the [different unicode font styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols#Tables_of_styled_letters_and_digits) as the examples in the README seems to suggest? What are the available options for `math_style_spec`?\r\n\r\nThe name `UnicodeMath` may be too general for this. Maybe `UnicodeMathStyles`?",

      "body": "Right, that makes sense. I definitely tink the package needs a more descriptive name, though. What I would expect from a package named `UnicodeMath` would probably be somewhat similar to what is already provided by the `to_latex` function in [UnicodeFun](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/UnicodeFun.jl). On that note: Doesn't `UnicodeFun` already include the functionality you are implementing here (`to_caligraphic` etc.)? If some specific style is missing there, maybe it would make more sense to contribute to `UnicodeFun`? @SimonDanisch\r\n\r\nIf it does make sense to continue with this package, based on your opening statement in https://github.com/Kolaru/MathTeXEngine.jl/pull/141#issue-3359428353\r\n\r\n> This is a WIP with the goal of enabling a bit more control over character shapes\r\n\r\nI would suggest `UnicodeCharacterShapes` as a more descriptive package name.\r\n\r\n> the available style specifications (:iso, :tex, :french, :upright, :literal) are not documented yet, at some point a little explanation will be added; \r\n\r\nI would urge you to do that _now_.
