Let's do that. I don't see this shaping up as anything controversial, but out of fairness, it would be best to do the registration once it meets the minimum criteria, and then give the community the standard 3-day period for feedback.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to close this, but just resubmit as soon as you have the code and README in place.",
