      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Please delete the `v0.2.1` tag from [tags](https://github.com/kunzaatko/InterfaceFunctions.jl/tags). The way this works for Julia packages is that [you have `TagBot`](https://github.com/kunzaatko/InterfaceFunctions.jl/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/TagBot.yml) automatically create tags after a registration is merged into the General registry. If you already created the tag manually, that will cause an error. And, of course, it prevents you from revising a release during the waiting period.",

I always thought that TagBot is only opt in and that I can manage tags manually in the same way with adding a release and everything. So the reason to use tags is that they are added only after the registry is merged and so the users are always kept up to date? Or is there any other reason why not to manage tags on my own?",

      "body": ">  I always thought that TagBot is only opt in\r\n\r\nWell, it is, in the sense that you don't have to use it. But it's \"recommended\", and you _are_ using it, by virtue of having [.github/workflows/TagBot.yml](https://github.com/kunzaatko/InterfaceFunctions.jl/blob/trunk/.github/workflows/TagBot.yml)\r\n\r\n> I can manage tags manually in the same way with adding a release and everything\r\n\r\nIf you're not using TagBot, you can do that, but you should still create the tag / release _after_ the version has been registered. The [reply in reaction to `@JuliaRegistrator register`](https://github.com/kunzaatko/InterfaceFunctions.jl/commit/1972e6bd013e66196fae7bd46b74a9bcf38fdee6#commitcomment-163056752) mentions this explicitly (\"**After** the above pull request is merged…\"). The reason is that you can never be completely sure that a registration will go through (even after the initial registration). You might have screwed up some `compat` bound. So when you comment `@Registrator register` on a commit, you cannot absolutely be sure that that is the commit the will be tagged. If the registration goes through, everything is fine, and it doesn't matter if you created the tag before or after.\r\n\r\n> I can also register lower versions such as v0.2.0 in the same way from my commit history?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it. Going back with the version number, or any jumps in numbering will cause problems, but I'm not sure if the JuliaRegistrator will reject it, or if it's just the Automerge bot. Probably the latter, which means it's possible by applying manual overrides.\r\n\r\nWhat you still can do, though, is to go back to `v0.2.0` for the initial registration. Just change the version number back and call `@JuliaRegistrator register again`. This will resurrect this PR, and we'd close https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/135573",
