I wasn't just looking at new package registrations. My feedback is consistent with my comments on the thread. I see no issue with having a package that does one thing `istwo`. Per the current policy, we do have a policy on starting versions and no-skipping of versions unless there is a compelling reason which is what my comments addressed. I am against editorializing the registration process. Giving feedback from the community, yes. He is more than welcome to update the PR to start the version at `v1.0.0` if he wants. Per the current guidelines it would be merged after the waiting period and I have no objections.",

      "body": "Just to close this out for anyone interested: the position espoused by some in this thread was that the registry should be open and that package quality or reasonableness should not be a factor in whether a package gets included in the registry [1] (counterargument here [2]). This came on the heels of a registration PR for a package that was obviously incorrect and was a simple single-function port of an obviously incorrect NPM package. The positions referenced above were made during the course of the debate over this package.\r\n\r\nFor the record, I am against the \"NPM-ification\" of the Julia Registry; I believe that packages should be curated with documented criteria that are as objective as possible and as unambiguous as possible when objectivity is difficult; and at the request of some of the project leaders, have started a discussion about it [3].\r\n\r\nThis PR was an attempt to figure out whether there was a set of undocumented subjective criteria that proponents of an open registry would use to deny an obviously-incorrect, simple, single-function package. From a correctness perspective, it is no more incorrect than the original package proposed.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, there does appear some line that even the most staunch supporters of an open registry refuse to cross. It is apparently the assessment of the author's \"faith\". I am glad for this. My only request is that we document it.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/issues/1856#issue-635438890\r\n[2] https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/15926#issuecomment-640578600\r\n[3] https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/16058",
