It's also (in my opinion) too much magic.\r\n\r\nThe current process isn't much different from other languages now:\r\n- Update the version in your project file (I don't know of any language ecosystem that doesn't make you do this yourself)\r\n- Create a release with Registrator (the parallels in other languages are  mostly command-line applications, i.e. `npm publish` etc.) \r\n\r\nSo I do agree that something like what you propose would be useful, but I think it's far from necessary. But if you want to make your case to the rest of the Julia folks you could open an issue on Registrator.jl! ",
