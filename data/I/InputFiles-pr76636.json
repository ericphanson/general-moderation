      "body": "[noblock] I tried to have a look at your documentation, but I'm not sure I quite understand what exactly the package does. *If* you want others to use this, you may want to give more context and examples. What does `setup_input` return? (seems like a dict?). What problem does it solve? How or why would I use this in my own scripts? This is not necessarily relevant to registering the package, but it might help with finding a good name.\r\n\r\nIf there's a distinctive core *idea* that can be expressed in one or two words, that would make a good prefix. If it's just \"input handling the way I like it\" (which is fine!), then I actually think `OLInputFiles` would make a great name.\r\n\r\nIn general, descriptive package names are great, but the more \"personal\" a package is, the more specific / long the package name should be, IMO. So `InputFiles` would be totally fine for a package managed by the [JuliaIO organization](https://github.com/JuliaIO). On the other hand, for a package that's \"just\" a dependency for a PhD project package, there's a high chance that the author will eventually move on, so then you want something that's really specific and won't possibly conflict with something other people might write in the future.\r\n\r\nFor the record, as far as I'm concerned, `ScriptInputPrep` is *probably* also long enough to not be a problem, but `OLInputFiles` is definitely safer. You could also ask in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) (the `#pkg-registration` channel) what other people think. I'm not exactly in a position of authority on any of this, really.",
