I've just lowered some overhead. It is significant if a function can be evaluated as quickly as Rosenbrock -- right now it's about 10% faster but with some improvements it could a bit better.\r\n\r\nI have a general idea of investigating applications of Riemannian optimization to various problems. We (me and Ronny) recently managed to remove Manopt.jl's overhead compared to Optim.jl. I've started a hyperparameter tuning example for Manopt/Optim and I'm currently looking for some students to test it on some problems from multivariate data analysis. We will see how it works out. Removing small overhead from line search isn't particularly significant for this goal and my time is divided between multiple different projects so I'm not sure how far I will go in this direction. Picking initial and max alpha could be significant though.",
