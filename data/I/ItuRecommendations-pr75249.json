Putting binary data, especially large one, in git repositories is never a good idea.  If you can upload it to a tarball hosted somewhere else, you can create an artifact with [`ArtifactUtils.jl`](https://github.com/simeonschaub/ArtifactUtils.jl) (this package can for example automatically create a tarball and upload it to github gist, read the README file).\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
