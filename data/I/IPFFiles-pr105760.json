      "body": "Thanks for making this package!\r\n\r\nBecause everyone who uses Julia shares the General registry namespace, we try to make sure the names are accessible to everyone (even folks who are not going to be using your package). When it comes to abbreviations, we try pretty hard to avoid non-obvious abbreviations. ([more detailed/official explanation here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines))\r\n\r\nThinking about IPF, specifically,\r\n\r\nFrom https://search.brave.com\r\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (\"IPF\")\r\nInformation Presentation Facility (\"programming IPF\")\r\n\r\nFrom https://www.acronymfinder.com/IPF.html\r\nInternational Polar Foundation\r\nInternal Protection Fault\r\n\r\nFrom the README of the package\r\n\"ESA/ESOC interpolation files or IPF\"\r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing IPF stands for \"interpolation files\", in which case IPFFiles is redundant (files twice).\r\n\r\nPerhaps `ESAInterpolationFiles.jl`? I think ESA is reasonably unambiguous. European space agency is the first result on brave,  google, bing, and yahoo; and esa is a direct redirect to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency  on wikapedia (not even a disambiguation page).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe repo description \"ESA Intepolation Files made easy\" makes the package name `ESAInterpolationFiles.jl` sound quite appealing.",

For example, AWS.jl, OpenAI.jl, etc.\r\n\r\n> I don't want to \"block\" any ESA-associated potential name, just in case at some points there are some open source packages from the agency itself.\r\n\r\nThank you for your concern. I appreciate this respect for the namespace. We do have a bit of a first-come-first served policy and you're first so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. Also, and more importantly, there is plenty of ESAXxxxYxxx.jl namespace left even with ESAInterpolationFiles.jl registered.\r\n\r\n> InterpolationFiles.jl would be too generic as a name\r\n\r\nI agree that `InterpolationFiles.jl` would be too generic a name, but if I am correct that IPFFiles is an abbreviation for InterpolationFileFiles, then that would also be too generic. Because the package only handles ESA files, it is appropriate to include ESA in the name.",
