Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Thank you for your input! I find `ImplicitBoundingVolumeHierarchy` quite painful to write - it'd fill an entire code line just to `using ImplicitBoundingVolumeHierarchy: BSphere` (which I wouldn't want to export directly as there are other `BBox` and `BSphere` in geometry-related libraries); I'm also trying not to burden users with import boilerplate - the package is very focused so I'd like to keep the API as minimalistic as possible.\r\n\r\nIn computer graphics / simulation / geometry, BVH - with this name - is the current standard in ray-tracing, collision detection, ambient occlusion, etc. On GitHub, most results for searching [`bvh` refer to that](https://github.com/search?q=bvh&type=repositories) - so I'd argue `BVH` is even clearer for its use than `BoundingVolumeHierarchy`.\r\n\r\nFollowing from @goerz , I'll rename the library `ImplicitBVH` and try to re-register - thank you.",
