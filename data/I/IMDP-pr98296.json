Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 11 existing packages.\n  <details>\n  <summary>Similar package names</summary>\n\n  1.

However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Thanks for the feedback @nilshg. I see your point and do take that into consideration. But I would really prefer to keep the name if at all possible for two reasons: (a) for people working with IMDPs, we rarely ever say the full name, but rather the abbreviation and (b) I have a `cu` function that I deliberately don't export as it clashes with CUDA.jl (and I want to keep that function name as they do almost the same thing). Thus, either the user would need to write `IntervalMDP.cu`, which I find needlessly verbose, or write both `using IntervalMDP` and `import IntervalMDP as IMDP` to keep `IMDP.cu`, which may confuse a new user of the library.

Thanks for showing me this. Not a nice syntax though IMO - it looks as if you are using a type named `IntervalMarkovDecisionProcesses` within the `IntervalMarkovDecisionProcesses` module. I would personally prefer a syntax like \r\n```julia\r\njulia> using IntervalMarkovDecisionProcesses as IMDP\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I digress.
