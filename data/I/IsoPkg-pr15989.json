Otherwise, I have to create environment for every small script.",

      "body": "Not similar. Just both enable install the newest packages. Personally I think without the features such as to load packages with specific version, and to install same packages with different version, the feature of JuliaLang/Pkg.jl#1607 has very little meaning. In fact, the purpose of IsoPkg is totally not for disabling compatibility check, but for making Julia work more smoothly as tools for researchers everyday work.\n\nI think current package manager is good for package developing, but too heavy for small working scripts. For example, several months ago, I wrote a script to solve a problem by using package A at v0.1.0. It works very fine. Now A upgrade to v0.2.0, the scrip cannot work with the new version. But I need to use the new features to write a new script to solve another problem. Without IsoPkg, I need to create environments and manage the toml files. With IsoPkg, I just need write @iso using A “0.1.0” in first script and @iso using A “0.2.0” in second one. These scripts will always work fine without worrying the package upgrading anymore. This also helps to share code snippets, otherwise you have to prepare two toml files for every piece of code for sharing to colleagues.\n\nCurrently, after you installed dozens packages, if you do not create new environments for every simple work, Julia will be in mess. There are always some packages conflicting with each other or breaking some scripts or downgrading some other packages or stopping some package upgrading. It stops Julia working as an convenient tools like matlab.\n\nOf course, I hope Julia itself can change the loading mechanism to respect the package version. Then Pkg.jl can install same packages with different version without breaking compatibility. I think this feature will solve all above troubles. It will be much better than using IsoPkg.",
