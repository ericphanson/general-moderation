Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- There is no compat entry for `julia`.\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: AbstractTrees, DataInterpolations, HDF5, JSON, Memoize, OrderedCollections, PCHIPInterpolation, PrecompileTools, StaticArraysCore\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "> How unreasonable would it be to keep the name as is?\r\n\r\nWell, you'd have to go on Slack, find a full registry maintainer, and convince them to merge it manually (cf. [the bot's explanation of the procedure](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/107980#issuecomment-2140725964)). Definitely possible, although it would probably be merged somewhat begrudgingly.\r\n\r\n> Also, we have a few other packages that are also all capital letters.\r\n\r\nThis might be a good time to review your package names and bring as much of it as possible in line with the [package naming guidelines](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines). Personally, I'm not opposed to package names with all-caps names. Specifically, pronounceable acronyms. Package names that would be acceptable if not in all-caps (as \"less systematic names\") should also be acceptable in all-caps. Still, it requires a manual merge and thus places a burden on the registry maintainers, so it's best to keep it to a minimum.\r\n\r\nIf you have a large, somewhat closed organization with dozens of packages with names that are unsuitable for the General registry, a `LocalRegistry` would be a good way to go. The one unfortunate consequence would be that packages in General would not be able to depend on those packages.\r\n\r\nP.S.: `HDF5.jl` and `JSON.jl` are both very common file formats. Besides, \"package X got an exception\" is never a good argument.",
