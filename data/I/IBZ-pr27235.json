Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an uppercase letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are uppercase.\n- Name is not at least five characters long\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: BenchmarkTools, CDDLib, Combinatorics, Conda, Coverage, Distances, Distributions, Documenter, DocumenterTools, IJulia, IntervalArithmetic, Plots, Polyhedra, PyCall, PyPlot, QHull, Reduce, Revise, StaticArrays, SymPy, julia\n- Package name similar to 5 existing packages.\n1. Similar to BBI. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n2. Similar to NPZ. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n3. Similar to ITK. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n4. Similar to FIB. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n5. Similar to Libz. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1.\n- I was not able to load the package (i.e. `import IBZ` failed). See the CI logs for details.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.
