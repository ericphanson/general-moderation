      "body": "Thanks for the links! I am of aware of [Gmsh.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFEM/Gmsh.jl), but had some issues building it in the past. I have also used [GmshTools.jl](https://github.com/shipengcheng1230/GmshTools.jl) a while back, but I don't feel I need the extra functionality it provides. If I recall correctly there were also some issues with building for windows at some point. \r\n\r\nFor my use case, I have found the easiest solution to be to just download the SDK from the *gmsh* website, and add the path of the `gmsh.jl` file that comes with it to my Julia load path. This package was just a way to more-or-less automatically handle that within the Julia package's ecosystem using artifacts. The solution is simple, works on linux, macOS, and windows, and avoids having to do a somewhat complex build if you want to use some advanced gmsh functionalities such as integration with Open Cascade or Metis.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I would be happy to combine efforts, use another package if it fulfils my current needs, or to just keep this unregistered if having yet-another-gmsh-package is undesirable...",
