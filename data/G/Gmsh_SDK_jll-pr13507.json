      "body": "Ideally, it should go to JuliaBinaryWrappers through [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/). However, building Gmsh was painful and my experience was not successful. It requires too many dependencies and some are not available at hand. So, I thought I could just wrap the official SDK and did some small tweaks to make it work on windows on Julia 1.4, in such case to make life easier. So I have `SDK` inside the name, in case someone else succeeds to compile Gmsh itself someday. Please let me know if it can stay here or move.\r\n",
