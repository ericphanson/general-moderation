Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to GeoStats. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1. Normalized visual distance 1.83 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

      "body": "@kongdd The MIT license is very permissive but its almost only requirement is that you keep the copyright notice, including the names of original authors of course. That's for the legal part of it. Now, you should also consider good community practices, which go beyond this. Why not reuse the `GeoArray` type from GeoArrays.jl instead of copying it to your package? This approach is generally favored as it avoids duplication of work and it also makes the contribution of original authors more visible.\r\n\r\nThere's also a problem with the name GeoStars, which is that there's a single-letter difference from the existing GeoStats.

GeoArrays.jl is a established package for some users and this only creates noise. You should use a different method to improve discoverability within the R community. Wiki pages, tutorials, notebooks. Not a registered package with a different name, period.\r\n2. The name Stars.jl is not descriptive enough. R packages have terrible naming conventions and we shouldn't be basing our naming conventions that way. Stars.jl can mean astronomical objects, can mean stencil stars in geometric processing (StarTIN.jl), it can mean all sorts of things.\r\n\r\nI keep my suggestion of simply removing the organization and using other methods to improve discoverability.",
