However, you will need to wait until a registry maintainer manually approves the name.**\n- Name is not at least five characters long\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

So, the original name for the package was indeed `ScoreDrivenModels.jl`, but we ended up changing It because score-driven models are a somewhat broader class than just GAS. We were avoiding `GASModels` because `GasModels` already exists (https://github.com/lanl-ansi/GasModels.jl) and we want to avoid confusions. We will discuss and come up with a better alternative.",
