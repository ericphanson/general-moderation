I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I'd just want to double-check that the name of the package isn't too general to describe its scope: Does this aspire to handle graph coloring in general (seems like it does!), or just some particular method(s) of graph coloring?\r\n\r\nAlso: could this package be moved to the [JuliaGraphs organization](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs)? It seems that [Graphs.jl itself also contains some support for coloring already](https://juliagraphs.org/Graphs.jl/v1.5/coloring/). How does this library compare and fit in? Would it make sense for `GraphColoring` to return a [`Graphs.Coloring`](https://juliagraphs.org/Graphs.jl/v1.5/coloring/#Graphs.Coloring) object, for better composability within the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nCC @gdalle as someone who seems to have been involved in Graphs.jl and it's coloring support and/or who might be able to connect with owners of the JuliaGraphs org to facilitate a move, if that's appropriate\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

      "body": "Thank you for the feedback!\r\n\r\nThe package is intended to serve as a general‑purpose graph‑coloring toolbox. It currently implements three families of algorithms: a greedy method, DSATUR, and the workstream approach.\r\n\r\nWhen I designed the package, I decided to keep it separate from Graphs.jl to maintain a lightweight and flexible code base. Consequently, Graphs.jl is listed only as a weak dependency. Users can also describe a graph with a sparse adjacency matrix directly in this framework, which eliminates the need for conversion to a Graphs type when that hierarchy may not be needed.\r\n\r\nWhile Graphs.jl already provides greedy and random coloring, this package also implements DSATUR coloring and the work‑stream method. The latter is especially useful for multithreaded applications, because it balances the sizes of color classes for parallel execution rather than solely minimizing the chromatic number.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to add an option to return a Graphs.Coloring object alongside the current interface, but I prefer to also keep the existing output format. It aligns better with the parallel‑processing use case, where the elements of each color are processed concurrently.\r\n\r\nIf the community feels it would be more appropriate, I am open to moving the repository under the JuliaGraphs organization in the future.",

      "body": "@djukic14 , you are the one that has put in the work to create this tool, which does provide sophisticated coloring capabilities, so I am in favor of any final decisions being made by you. I do believe it would be beneficial to the community to do the following:\r\n\r\n- Move the package to the JuliaGraphs organization (with you being the owner of the package of course), so that if the single maintainer of such generically name package disappears there is someone else who can help with maintenance.\r\n- Sometime soon make sure that the package can be easily used as a backend for Graphs.jl coloring (I will post an issue to your package about that shortly) and have the documentation of Graphs.jl refer to GraphColoring.jl as a way to access more coloring algorithms.\r\n\r\nGiven that this seems to be a package implementing significantly more capabilities on graph coloring than other parts of the ecosystem, I think it is warranted to take a high profile name in the General registry namespace -- I am in favor of accepting the registration.\r\n\r\n@djukic14 , this is almost a silly question, but it is helpful to have explicit confirmation when managing the future of the General registry namespace -- could you confirm you will be welcoming to contributions of additional coloring algorithms to your package (so that it can be a home for this type of algorithms in the Graphs.jl ecosystem)?",
