Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- No licenses detected in the package's top-level folder. An OSI-approved license is required.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Sorry, we can’t make exceptions. Quoting from @giordano \r\n\r\n> this registry is maintained by volunteers, we don't have a legal team that can thoroughly review any added clause, as simple as it may seem to you. Restriction of use (like no commercialisation), however, often goes against some definitions of open source software (it certainly violates one of the freedoms in the definition of [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)). Simply using OSI-approved licenses with no added custom clauses is the best way for us to ensure we have packages legally sounding license.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/31549#issuecomment-796671872\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following comment also looks relevant here as well:\r\n\r\n> I will add here that any \"no commercialization\" clause is almost certain to conflict with the GPL: the GPL requires that the derived work be available under terms compatible with the GPL, which guarantees a wide range of freedoms, regardless of the nature of the application. Since Julia by default ships with GPL libraries, it is very likely that any work derived from a package with this license would be illegal. While it's probably ok to have the end user load the package themselves, it is likely that any application that includes the package would not be legal. It would be necessary to compile a no-GPL version of Julia from source in order to legally create a work derived from the package.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/31549#issuecomment-804196208",
