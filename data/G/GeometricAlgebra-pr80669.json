I would prefer not to rush with package registration for a name which members of the JuliaGeometricAlgebra organization agreed is central and require careful thought before using. Once a package has been registered, changing it significantly in terms of content and/or ownership is not trivial and would cause unnecessary inconvenience to users. Alternatives to an early registration taking into account motivations of the author were already suggested which would leave time before reaching a more consensual decision on this matter.",

I think there's a few good names that would suit your structure of this library.",
