      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Repo URL does not end with /name.jl.git, where name is the package name\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: DataStructures, Genie, GenieFramework, Stipple, StippleUI\n- No licenses detected in the package's top-level folder. An OSI-approved license is required.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

I'm not sure the name is good, and I'm not sure it's helpful to others (WIP) already:\r\n\r\n> What is it?\r\n> This is initial scaffolding for a\r\n> \r\n> * reactive Webapp for Life Insurance Contracts\r\n> [..]\r\n> It is built with Genie Builder, which at the moment cannot be used in GITPOD. But the app can be run in GITPOD as shown below. To run it under GenieBuilder You have to use a non-cloud computer. This app is not runnable in Genie Cloud, as it builds on postgres and cannot be run with mysql.\r\n> \r\n> MVVM Architecture\r\n> This app leverages the great Genie Framework\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused, is it an \"app\" (those should not be registered I think, in general) or \"scaffolding\" for one.\r\n\r\n@essenciary made Genie, and while I'm not sure it's a trademark, I'm not sure it should be used in the name of packages/products using it. I would at least like to know what he thinks about it. It seems like an implementation detail of your package, and while it might never change, I could see it hypothetically happening, so would you want to be stuck with it then as part of the package's name?\r\n\r\nI like packages registered, the ecosystem growing, so if/when the package is useful for others (then OSI-licenced a requirement), please do (with some good name).\r\n\r\nFYI you can do:\r\n```\r\n(@v1.9) pkg> add https://github.com/Actuarial-Sciences-for-Africa-ASA/GenieBuiltLifeProto\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's no need to register all packages (and for some a local registry makes sense).",
