      "body": "Actually I don't really like the name, too. In super long it's GeoInterfaceSortTileRecursiveTree. In geo-informatics \"sort tile recursive\" is commonly abbreviated as STR and the julia package GeoInterface as GI, hence the GISTR. As the audience is rather narrow I thought contracting the name is ok. Regarding the camel case, I'm following what the [comparable python package](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/strtree.html) does - but that's of course not a proper argument. I'm a bit uncertain how to proceed. Maybe GeoInterfaceSTRTree?",
