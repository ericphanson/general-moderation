I think it would be nice if you added a comment about this e.g. in the LICENSE file, and at the top of those copied files. IANAL but seems like you should at least acknowledge the original source here.\r\n\r\nAlso, https://github.com/shipengcheng1230/GmshTools.jl/blob/f6ea5a98b8f43d9b847107c024e234c53e0411fa/src/GmshTools.jl#L9 seems like a really bad idea, but we don't have to discuss that here.",

I added descriptions on top of those ported files and changed the license compatible with Gmsh GPLv2.\r\n\r\nAs for the `Base.include` usage, that's a temporary solution for v4.3.0 on linux without segment fault. I don't see discussion of this function (would be great if you could refer such).\r\n\r\nThanks.",
