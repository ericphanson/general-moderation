Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

      "body": "Dear Julia package registration administrator, \r\n\r\nWe would like to request that this package be manually merged. We understand that (as reported by the auto-merge bot) we are currently failing on the naming convention of our package on the following two grounds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. Name is not at least 5 characters long\r\n    2. Package name similar to 4 existing packages.\r\n        Similar to Gen. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1.\r\n        Similar to Lens. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n        Similar to Genie. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n        Similar to GenTeX. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n\r\nHowever, the GenX package has already gained a wide degree of popularity and acceptance among the electricity capacity expansion planning community. As such, due to legacy reasons, it's very difficult to change the name by any manner without incurring any confusion, extra hassle, and complications among our world-wide community of users, developers, researchers, and clients.  \r\n\r\nWe, therefore, sincerely request the administrators to consider our case as a special case and request that our GenX package be registered as an official Julia package.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nGenX development team,\r\n(Jesse Jenkins, Princeton University-ZERO Lab,\r\nRuaridh Macdonald, MIT-Energy initiative,\r\nDharik Mallapragada, New York University-Tandon School of Engineering)\r\n",

More details at : https://genx.mit.edu\n- Release notes:\n<!-- BEGIN RELEASE NOTES -->\n> This present version of GenX.jl through this new release introduces a few new modules and technologies. It also introduces a new version of the folder structure for case studies and a reformatted version of the input files for demand, reserves and resources. The documentation pages have also been updated to reflect these new changes as well as we have a much more logically consistent and user-friendly structure of organization of the documentation pages. We hope, this will cater better and more effectively, all kinds of users, whether developers/contributors, or energy modelers.\n<!-- END RELEASE NOTES -->",
