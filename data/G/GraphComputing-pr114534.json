      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Hey, thanks.\r\nI can see that the name may be confusing... I dislike the suggestion though, because it seems harder to remember, and it being a directed acyclic graph isn't really the core of the things the package provides. Maybe I can come up with a better idea still.\r\n\r\n> As a side note, are you aware of [Dagger.jl](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/Dagger.jl)?\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the package, yes, but I decided to use my own implementation of a graph to have very specific control of the metadata I can store in it. I'm aware that my graph representation is not the prettiest or fastest at the moment, but I have some plans to improve this. It has worked well enough until now though.",
