      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Surely, that's a typo (or if not, I would consider that highly misleading). I'm not really concerned about `GivEm` vs `GiveEm` (or `Givem` or `GiveThem`), although me just automatically typing `GiveEm` might be an indication that people are going to be likely to have problems typing the package name.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

It is also not about \"giving them\" MS® Excel®, it is about giving them a file in XLSX format (which is an ISO standard, I think). So it is about \"somewhat having to do with MS Excel, or maybe not\", which I think is expressed by the \"incorrect\" spelling. See also the following footnote from the docs:\r\n\r\n_throughout the text, \"excel file\" (no capitalisation) and \"XLSX file\" will be used interchangeably and denote files in the XLSX format, which can be produced and read by MS Excel as well as other software, e.g. LibreOffice._\r\n\r\nI do not expect people would really have problems typing the package name, especially as the package is not intended for the end user, but for developers of in-house packages.\r\n\r\nNow, if you consider the current name unsuitable I'd change it exactly to whatever you propose. Thank you 🙂",

I don't see how misspelling it indicates that it has \"something to do with Excel, or maybe not\". If you *insist*, I can unblock… It seems like a bad name to me, but if you really want that name, I don't see that I should police your decision. But maybe we should get some more maintainer eyeballs on this to see how they feel about deliberate misspellings.\r\n\r\n`GivEmXL` or `GivEmXLSX` seem like more suitable names, if you want to avoid the Excel brand name.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
