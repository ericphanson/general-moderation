I'm not saying there should be no standard, I'm just saying that isn't a good one.\r\n\r\nThat's a good point, so permit me to clarify what I meant - the package as it is now bears a striking resemblance to those \"personal utility package\"s that the rule was originally meant to capture. So in a world where this package is registered, can someone with their personal favorite collection of `const` alias definitions also register that package? That'd mean the personal utility rule would be quite useless, as the line between \"package providing functionality\" and \"personal utility package\" gets blurrier and blurrier, even more so than the wording in the current README is.\r\n\r\nThe reason that rule exists, as I understand it, is exactly to prevent this kind of custom aliasing of names, with nothing else on top; there is the minimum standard (even in General) that a package must provide some functionality of its own, and this package (to my eyes) simply doesn't pass that bar.",
