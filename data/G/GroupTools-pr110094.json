I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "> This package has a narrow usefulness for people working with groups. It is a dependency of other packages of mine (those are of general usefulness) that I wish to publish.\r\n\r\nYes, that was exactly my impression, and that's totally fine.\r\n\r\n> 1. If it were possible to keep this package on GitHub and have it as a dependency, I would do that, but I understand this is not possible?\r\n\r\nYes, a dependency of a registered package also has to be registered, which makes this absolutely fine to register.\r\n\r\n> 2. I really don't care about the name (as this is only ever going to be used as a dependency, I guess). `ManifoldGroupTools` is as good as any other name.\r\n\r\nFrom the description \"Useful functions to work with groups defined in `Manifolds.jl`\" I got the impression that this was going to be an internal dependency mainly for `Manifolds`. Hence the suggestion for the name `ManifoldGroupTools`. In general, `<NameOfMainDependentOrOrg>GroupTools` seems like the most appropriate name. As the maintainer of `Manifolds`, you can use that as sort of a name space that you own (just like many packages have `Base` packages).\r\n\r\nAlso, for packages that aren't user facing but merely serve as a dependency, having a long and descriptive name is a good idea. That leaves `GroupTools` still open for a more general, user-facing package related to group theory.\r\n\r\nThe longer and more descriptive the package name (and especially for \"internal\" packages), the less scrutiny I would put on it for registration, e.g., in terms of how much documentation there should be at the time of registration. In general, I think there should always be a paragraph in the README that explains the context and scope of the package and links to the main dependent.\r\n\r\nIt's also never a bad idea to set up a very basic online documentation with Documenter that just shows all the docstrings (or, I suppose you could rely on JuliaHub doing that for you automatically and link to their documentation from the README). That's definitely more optional for an internal package.\r\n\r\n> Do I have to re-register with that other name?\r\n\r\nYes, unfortunately. See the FAQ on [What to do when asked to reconsider/update the package name?](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#what-to-do-when-asked-to-reconsiderupdate-the-package-name)\r\n",
