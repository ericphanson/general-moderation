Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 8 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to JOLI. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 1.97 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to JLD2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to JLD. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to CUDD.

Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Hello\r\n\r\nI apologize for yet another non-complying package name. Similar to JOLI.jl last week, this package was created in 2016 for julia 0.6 before these guidelines. We would like to keep that name for other packages built on top of it since then. We think the name is different enough from the ones listed above as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.",
