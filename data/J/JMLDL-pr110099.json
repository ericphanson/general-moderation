      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) which are not met ❌\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Package name similar to 4 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to JMcDM. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  2. Similar to QDLDL. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to JLD2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to JLD. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\n## 3. *Needs action*: here's what to do next\n\n1. Please try to update your package to conform to these guidelines. The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\n2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\n\nIf you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [public Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) for better visibility.\n\n## 4. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nYes you are right sorry, this is the first time I am registering a package. \r\nIn fact this package will be for my students in a course where I will teach ML, DL & RL subjects. I want to show them how to write common algorithms from scratch. And I thought may be a good opportunity to begin creating a new ML/DL Julia package. \r\n\r\nAbout your question on the difference between the existing packages. They are all great packages but I want to create a more compact and easy to use package like Python scikit learn. I mean not a wrapper but a package with scikit learn functionality written in %100 Julia.  \r\n\r\nTo sum up my focus will be more educational, and from-scratch. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is anything I should do.",
