Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to Javis. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

      "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nThe reason `JavisNB` can't be installed or loaded is that it depends on a version of `Javis` that is yet to be released. This is the case because most the functionality of JavisNB are exported from `Javis` itself and it will be the package holding all the notebooks functionalities. However, doing this required some changes in `Javis` that will be available in the next release, the one `JavisNB` depends on.\r\n\r\nThat said, we though it was not the case to relax the compat because otherwise there would be a downloadable release of `JavisNB` that does not work. At the same time if we release `Javis` 0.8 right now there would be no way to use it within a notebook until `JavisNB` is itself released.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to go?\r\n\r\nThanks you in advance!\r\n\r\nTaggin others for reference\r\n@Wikunia",
