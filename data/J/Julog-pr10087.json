      "body": "> How do you feel about `LogicProgramming.jl`?\r\n> \r\n> `Logic.jl` is also available.\r\n\r\nI was considering `Logic.jl`, but decided that both of them would be too general. There are other logic programming languages like [`miniKanren`](https://github.com/latticetower/MuKanren.jl), and so I didn't want to take up namespace in the registry with something as specific as a Prolog-variant. \r\n\r\nI like `Julog` because it communicates that it is Prolog-based, while not exactly being Prolog. It follows the pattern of other Prolog variants, like Datalog, Problog, AnsProlog, etc. It also makes for a convenient macro name for parsing logical formulas. `@julog` is memorable and short, doesn't clash with `@prolog` (which is a macro this package provides to parse Prolog strings directly, though it doesn't handle full Prolog syntax), and is specific enough that it is unlikely to clash with other packages (whereas a macro like `@logic` seems much more likely to do that).",
