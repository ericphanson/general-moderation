      "body": "Thank you all for the feedback. Would be **Zmq4Labview.jl**  OK? \r\n\r\nThis is an auxillary package for LabVIEW binding over Zmq. It contains most of the Julia functionality, the main package (to be registered soon) containing mostly LabVIEW. I have made it separate first to be able to provide separate updates for each sub-system, and secondly because this package could in principle be used independently of LabVIEW to connect to other environments/languages.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with the suggested name (or suggest a better one), I would pull the registration back, refactor the package for the new name, set the version to 0.1.0 and register it again. \r\n\r\nHow can I cancel the registration? Would any of you cancel it?",
