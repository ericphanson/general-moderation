Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 3 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to JuLIP. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  2. Similar to YOLO. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to JLD. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Hello\r\n\r\nConcerning the naming guidelines. This is a package we started developing a while ago, in 2016 to be exact with Julia 0.5. Since then, we have built numerous packages on top of it so it would be a nightmare to rename the package at this point. We would therefore want to keep the current package name. We were up to that point working with our own registry (https://github.com/slimgroup/SLIMregistryJL), but since some users seem to not like having an additional registry, we are moving towards registering some of our most used packages and most rely on this one.\r\n\r\nConcerning the `compat` section, we never ran in compatibility issues over the years so we never needed it. If you absolutely require one, we will try to add it.\r\n\r\nthank you\r\n",
