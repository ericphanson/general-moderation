      "body": "Dear Julia Team,\r\n\r\nGood Afternoon!\r\n\r\nWe apologize that our package \"JudiLing\" doesn't meet the guidelines of the name starting with \"Ju\". When we started this package/project, we haven't thought about register this package in Julia registry and read the guidelines, but now as more collaborative research projects have started using our package, we decided to publish our package in Julia registry. Thus, our users can have easy installation/upgrade/downgrade process against all different versions since many of them are from Psycholinguistics and not familiar with git and Julia. Since they already finalized/submitted their paper, changing our package name would lead to a broken link on our git repo and confuse future readers with two different names. Therefore, we would like to retain our package name \"JudiLIng\". Again, we apologize that we didn't read the guidelines initially when we started this project and we appreciate if we can have this name registered in the Julia registry.\r\n\r\nWith regards,\r\nXuefeng Luo\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
