Are you thinking it is that error that caused CI to fail, as opposed to the longer-than-four-character package name requirement?\r\n\r\nWith respect to the \"Some registries failed to update\" message, I'm not sure I know how to solve that, but let me know if I can do anything to help to understand it.\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\nSam \r\n\r\n**[edit]**  It occurred to me that the key is that the message mentions that the registry is **detached**.  I'm guessing that there is something in the CI that causes the registry to be detached, and, subsequently, there is probably logic in Pkg.jl that skips updating registries that are detached.  I think that makes sense.  In addition, I looked at other packages that do pass the CI, and they contain the same message about failing to update the detached registry.  Hope that helps.  Sam",
