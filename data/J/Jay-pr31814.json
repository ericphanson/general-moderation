      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least five characters long\n- Repo URL does not end with /name.jl.git, where name is the package name\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: CSV, DataFrames, ImageMagick, Images, LightXML, ProgressMeter, julia\n- Package name similar to 8 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Tau. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  2. Similar to Yao. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to Tar. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to Jags. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  5. Similar to JLD. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  6. Similar to Why. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  7. Similar to JDF. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  8. Similar to Lazy. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

I found this explanation:\n\nhttps://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/compatibility/\n\nbut that webpage does not explain how to come up with upper bound values.\nDo you just have to indicate some future (i.e. not yet existent) version\nnumber? So, if a dependency is at version 0.2.3 I would just use 0.3 as the\nupper bound under [compat]?\n\nThanks,\n\nMartin\n\n\n\nOp ma 15 mrt. 2021 om 13:47 schreef Eric Hanson ***@***.***>:\n\n> Reopened #31814 <https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/31814>.\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/31814#event-4458490656>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEPAFBVXFQFTOQVVPZW3OODTDX6WNANCNFSM4ZCRKINQ>\n> .\n>\n",
