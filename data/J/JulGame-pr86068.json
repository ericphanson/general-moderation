Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name starts with \"Ju\".\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I'd like to make an argument for why I would like to keep the name. I've been working on this project on and off for about a year, and finally came upon the name JulGame. I think that it is short and sweet. I think it feels good to say. This name encapsulates what the project is about. \"Jul\" is the etymological root of “jolly” as well as the prefix for Julia, making it a pun that works well with “Games”. I am not associated with Julia (obvious to us here). This is also a play on [pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame). They are also not associated with python. The reason I started working on this project is that I think that it could help create a new game dev community for Julia, as it is extremely small at the moment. I think this could be a welcoming tool to getting more people interested in Julia. I only started using Julia because I was interested in it after reading about it. After working with it for hundreds of hours, I love it. I'd like to see other people find that love for the language. I'd like to see it through with this name. Thank you for the consideration.",
