However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "If a longer name for this package is desired, it would be `VariantCallFormat.jl`. I do however think that `VCF.jl` is more appropriate.\r\n* VCF files are used a lot in bioinformatics and that's the term that people use. Fewer people would recognize Variant Call Format.\r\n* 99.9% of user who need this package already have VCF files produced by other tools. So `VCF.j` is the natural package name to search for.\r\n* Several other package names, like `CSV.jl` and `XLSX.jl` use the file extension as the package name.\r\n\r\nPreviously, VCF file IO existed in the not actively maintained package [GeneticVariation.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/GeneticVariation.jl/tree/master). It makes more sense to have it in a separate package, with fewer dependencies.\r\nSince `VCF.jl` is building on GeneticVariation.jl v0.4, I choose v0.5 as the starting version number for `VCF.jl`.",
