Didn't know that this is impossible.\r\n\r\nWhile filling in the contents, I decided to change the package name to `VoxelwiseConstantMapping`.  Initiating the registration of the renamed package created a new PR.  Therefore, I would like to close this PR, and also would like to discontinue the registration procedure of the old package described in this PR.",
