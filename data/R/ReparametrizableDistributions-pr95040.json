The General registry is a community resource. Some issues with new registrations can be flagged by bots, but others (like incomplete documentation) cannot, so anyone can flag these submissions.\r\n\r\nUsually, after issues are fixed, the registration should be unblocked for automatic merging. Again, I'm sorry that didn't happen in this case.\r\n",
