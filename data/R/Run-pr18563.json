I think they are pretty clear about what they do.\r\n\r\nYes, that is very slick :smile: But it seems like there are many other things that could be called \"Run\", and you could also accomplish it by having a submodule called `Run`, i.e.\r\n```julia\r\nimport IsolatedEnvironments: Run\r\nRun.test()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyways, this is a subjective decision, so probably the best thing is to get others to weigh in - just registering my opinion.",
