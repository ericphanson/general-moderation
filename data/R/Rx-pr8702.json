      "body": "@DilumAluthge That's a good point, but `ReactiveX` name will also lead to confusion with existing [JuliaGizmos/Reactive.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Reactive.jl) package (which looks abandoned and provides less functionality).\r\n\r\n[ReactiveX](https://github.com/ReactiveX) is a collection of repositories with reactive extensions for several languages. They use the same naming convention: `Rx` + language name, which in case  of Julia results in exactly `Rx.jl`.\r\n\r\nReactive community is quite big nowadays and in my opinion it is better to follow the established naming convention. Abbreviation `Rx` can also mean medical prescription, but in the context of  software development `Rx` is commonly used for reactive frameworks. As an example, google query \"rx github\" results in only reactive extension frameworks.",

We can use something like `ReactiveX` but this will lead to confusion between `ReactiveX`, `Reactive`, `React` packages so it is not sensible anymore for the most of the users. \r\n\r\nWe can use the name without 'reactive' in it (like [Akka](https://akka.io) does), but it also may confuse developers who are familiar with this paradigm, because it is a common naming convention in this field of software developing. \r\n\r\n> Avoid jargon. In particular, avoid acronyms unless there is minimal possibility of confusion.\r\n\r\nThis part of the Julia package naming convention is controversial and subjective. From my point of view there is zero possibility of confusion with `Rx.jl` while others may have different opinion. \r\n\r\nThank you for your comments, we will consider other name next week and we can continue this conversation to find a good solution.",
