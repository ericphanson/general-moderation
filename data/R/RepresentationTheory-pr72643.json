Instead, `Gadfly`, `PyPlot`, `Winston` and other packages each implement a unique approach based on a particular design philosophy.\r\n> * In contrast, `SortingAlgorithms` provides a consistent interface to use many well-established sorting algorithms.\r\n\r\n`RepresentationTheory` feels precisely like `SortingAlgorithms` to me.\r\n\r\n[noblock] \r\n",

      "body": "I would say this is a first attempt and I'm happy to accept other contributions. In particular I'm planning to support other groups like D_8 and hopefully some compact Lie groups.\r\n\r\nThat said, your package seems very different in nature. For example, adding \"support\" for characters would be a one line addition in my package: `character(ρ::Representation, g) = tr(ρ(g))`. But that's probably not actually what you have in mind. Further, my representations are all over the reals (or more accurately, `Float64`) which seems different from anything with the name \"Symbolic\". \r\n\r\nSo I'm more than happy to rename the package. That said, I don't have a good name! Maybe RepresentationTheoryLinearAlgebra.jl to emphasise this is a linear algebra-based approach? Or NumericalRepresentationTheory.jl?",
