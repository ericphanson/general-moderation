      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: Sockets\n- I was not able to load the package (i.e. `import Rocket_threaded` failed). See the CI logs for details.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Hello @goerz Frankly I want to experiment with some ideas before I will go with PR for contribution - Hovewer I need to check it within my packages. So the problem is I am updating package MedPipe3D  that depends on MedEye3D and MedEye3D depends on Rocket.jl In order to test MedPipe3D I need to load MedEye3D with updated dependencies to my fork of Rocket. Hvewer in order to do this I need to put my dependency on my Fork to Rocket in Project.toml of MedEye3d.\r\n\r\nSummarising Can I add to the project.toml of a package in [compat] section a link to github repo of the fork instead of the package version?\r\nI would like to add sth like \r\n```\r\n[compat]\r\nRocket_threaded = \"https://github.com/jakubMitura14/Rocket_threaded.jl\"\r\n```\r\nto project.toml of MedEye3D\r\n\r\nthen load MedEye3D by\r\n```\r\nPkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/jakubMitura14/MedEye3d.jl.git\")\r\n``` \r\nThen I would not need to register fork as a new package for experimentation - is it possible?",
