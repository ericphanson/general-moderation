      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Thank you for submitting your package! However, looking at the project on GitHub, it very much seems like this is in a _very_ early stage of development. That makes the tag `v0.0.1` appropriate, but it is not quite yet at the `v0.1.0` stage that we ask packages to be in before they are registered in General. See [Should I register my package now](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#should-i-register-my-package-now) in the FAQ.\r\n\r\n[My recommendation](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/when-does-it-make-sense-to-post-a-new-package-to-the-julia-repository/108701/4) for an initial registration is that the package has sufficient functionality to be useful to the general public, and a sufficient amount of documentation to get people started with using the package. At a minimum, that would be a description of the package's purpose and a small usage example in the README. Having automated tests in place is also strongly recommended.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, I definitely recommend setting up a [Documenter](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/)-based documentation. Before a `v1.0` release, or for smaller packages that can be effectively described entirely with their `README`, that's not a requirement, though.\r\n\r\nIf you want to tag versions <0.1, I would suggest using a [LocalRegistry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl) for the time being. Definitely try registering again when the package reaches 0.1, though!\r\n\r\nLastly, I would also ask that you are conscious of using a very general package name. I'm not sure how general the name \"Radiomics\" is. If the package has a broad enough scope to reasonably fit that name (or if it's a mostly \"made up\" name), then by all means: go ahead. Otherwise, a narrower name may be better so that it doesn't \"block\" other (potentially bigger) packages in the same field. The more general the name, the more scrutiny should be placed on the package, including questions on whether the package is expected to be maintained in the long term. Ultimately, this is largely in your judgement, but I just wanted to raise the potential concern.\r\n",
