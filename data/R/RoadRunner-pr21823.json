Please see the attached picture.\r\n<img width=\"804\" alt=\"import_and_add\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3339893/94198474-2e019480-fe6c-11ea-9ebd-1f7bc4e25f19.png\">\r\n\r\nI am afraid the AutoMerge does not go through because this package is only applicable to windows 64 due to the Dynamic-link library files (libantimony.dll and roadrunner_c_api.dll under /src), which is necessary.\r\nHope to have your approval soon. Thanks in advance.\r\nJin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Maybe you could make your `__init__` something like\r\n```julia\r\nfunction __init__()\r\n    @static if Sys.iswindows()\r\n        global rrlib = Libdl.dlopen(rr_api)\r\n        global antlib = Libdl.dlopen(antimony_api)\r\n    else\r\n        @warn \"This platform isn't supported by RoadRunner.jl\"\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n?  In this way the user trying to use your package on a different platform will be gracefully warned, instead of causing a bad crash.  Also, this will let AutoMerge work",
