      "body": "Thank you for submitting your registration. I apologize if this might come off a bit blunt, or if I'm misreading the status of this project, but are you sure that this is something that is ready for registration and that you can personally stand behind?\r\n\r\nHow does this project compare (or fit in) with the whole [BinaryBuilder ecosystem](https://binarybuilder.org) for building Julia wrappers around C++ libraries? What is the motivation for the package?\r\n\r\nThis _very_ much looks like a completely LLM-generated package. The description \"Automated C++ to Julia Build System - Point it at C++ code, get a Julia library\" would indicate an enormously large and technically advanced scope. Not something that is easily achievable by a single person. Certainly not something that can be generated by an LLM.\r\n\r\nWhile it is fine to involve LLM tools like Claude in the development of a package, packages that are auto-generated without _extensive_ human involvement, planning and testing are not something that are suitable for registration, IMO. This package appears to have large amounts of \"LLM slop\". None of the tests or examples actually run, and there are plenty of non-sensical details, broken links, etc. There is no coherent documentation.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the large amounts of auto-generated material make the project look mature at first glance, which is a misrepresentation of the actual state of the project, as best as I can tell.\r\n\r\nIf you are planning to build a genuine \"Automated C++ to Julia Build System\", I would very much encourage you to engage with the community on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org) to get some feedback on such an endeavor. But please do not submit LLM-generated packages to the General registry.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, this needs a lot more work before it should be registered.",

      "body": "# RepliBuild Clarification Response\r\n\r\nI think there's some confusion about what RepliBuild actually does. Let me clarify.\r\n\r\n**BinaryBuilder and RepliBuild are not the same thing.** They solve completely different problems:\r\n\r\n**BinaryBuilder.jl:**\r\n- Package distribution system\r\n- Pre-compiles binaries for end users\r\n- Use case: Publishing packages to General registry\r\n\r\n**RepliBuild.jl:**\r\n- Development-time build automation\r\n- Automated C++ → Julia pipeline\r\n- Use case: Actively developing C++ code that needs Julia bindings\r\n\r\n## What RepliBuild Actually Does\r\n\r\nRepliBuild is a complete automated build system that replaces the manual process of:\r\n\r\n1. Writing CMakeLists.txt\r\n2. Running Clang.jl for AST parsing\r\n3. Hand-writing CxxWrap.jl bindings\r\n4. Configuring LLVM toolchains\r\n5. Managing incremental builds\r\n6. Tracking dependencies\r\n\r\n**Current Julia workflow to wrap C++:**\r\n```\r\n1. Write CMakeLists.txt\r\n2. Configure build system  \r\n3. Parse headers with Clang.jl\r\n4. Write CxxWrap.jl wrapper code manually\r\n5. Compile with correct flags\r\n6. Debug linking errors\r\n7. Repeat every time you make a change\r\nTime: Hours to days\r\n```\r\n\r\n**With RepliBuild:**\r\n```julia\r\nusing RepliBuild\r\nRepliBuild.compile(\"/path/to/cpp/project\")\r\n# Done. 5-10 seconds. Fully automated.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Full Pipeline\r\n\r\nWhen you point RepliBuild at a C++ project:\r\n\r\n1. **Discovers** all sources and headers automatically\r\n2. **Analyzes** AST dependencies (100+ files supported)\r\n3. **Detects** LLVM toolchain (52+ tools)\r\n4. **Generates** complete configuration (replibuild.toml)\r\n5. **Compiles** C++ → LLVM IR → Optimized shared library\r\n6. **Extracts** all exported symbols and verifies them\r\n7. **Caches** everything for 16-200x faster rebuilds\r\n8. **Watches** files for continuous compilation (daemon mode)\r\n\r\n## Performance Numbers\r\n\r\n| Build Type | Time | vs Traditional |\r\n|-----------|------|----------------|\r\n| First Build | 5-10s | Baseline |\r\n| Incremental | 0.3-2s | **16-50x faster** |\r\n| No Changes | 0.1s | **200x faster** |\r\n\r\nThese aren't theoretical - these are measured results from the test suite (27 end-to-end tests, all passing).\r\n\r\n## Why This Is Needed\r\n\r\nEvery major language has automated build systems for native interop:\r\n- **Python**: pybind11 (but still requires manual setup)\r\n- **Rust**: cargo (fully automated)\r\n- **Go**: cgo (automatic)\r\n- **JavaScript**: node-gyp (automated)\r\n\r\nJulia has the pieces (CxxWrap, Clang.jl, BinaryBuilder) but **no integrated automation for the development loop**. That's the gap RepliBuild fills.\r\n\r\n## How This Relates to BinaryBuilder\r\n\r\n**They're complementary:**\r\n- Use **RepliBuild** during development (fast iteration, auto-configuration)\r\n- Use **BinaryBuilder** when publishing to General (distribution, cross-platform binaries)\r\n\r\nOne is for your local machine while you're writing code. The other is for packaging and distributing to users. Different problems, different tools.\r\n\r\n## Real Use Cases\r\n\r\n**Scenario 1:** You have a C++ library with 50+ functions you need in Julia\r\n- Current way: Manually write wrappers for each function\r\n- RepliBuild: Automatic discovery and wrapping\r\n\r\n**Scenario 2:** You're iterating on a performance-critical C++ kernel\r\n- Current way: Full recompile every change (30-100 seconds)\r\n- RepliBuild: Incremental rebuild (0.3-2 seconds)\r\n\r\n**Scenario 3:** You want to wrap an external C++ project\r\n- Current way: Learn CMake, figure out build flags, write wrappers\r\n- RepliBuild: Point it at the project directory, done\r\n\r\n## Comparison to Julia Tools\r\n\r\n| Tool | What It Does | Overlap with RepliBuild? |\r\n|------|-------------|-------------------------|\r\n| BinaryBuilder.jl | Package distribution | No - different lifecycle stage |\r\n| CxxWrap.jl | Julia↔C++ bindings | Yes - RepliBuild uses it internally |\r\n| Clang.jl | Parse C/C++ AST | Yes - RepliBuild includes this + full pipeline |\r\n| CMake | Build configuration | Yes - RepliBuild replaces or imports it |\r\n\r\n## The Bottom Line\r\n\r\nRepliBuild automates the entire C++ → Julia development workflow with zero manual configuration. It's not competing with BinaryBuilder - it's solving a different problem that currently requires manually orchestrating multiple tools.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make C++ interop in Julia as simple as `import` in Python.",

      "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nYou said\r\n\r\n> and llm generation is mandatory for something big.\r\n\r\nI disagree to that, even strongly. Large packages should be much more carefully thought through designed and implemented.\r\nAnd one thing I think packages - and hence also the registry - should be careful about is to not confuse users. In your Readme there is a link https://yourusername.github.io/RepliBuild.jl claiming to link to the docs, but that can not work, since `yourusername` seems to be a place where the AI has not been able to find your username.\r\n\r\nI personally do not use AI beyond slightly advanced refactoring and would also prefer if packages I use would not be autogenerated in one commit. Even _if_ you do that, then you should be very very sure, the code is correct, well-documented, and usable.\r\n\r\nYou said you are learning, but also\r\n\r\n> I have tried discourse and forum but nothing gets responded to because its not related to topic conversation\r\n\r\nI am not sure I can agree to that. Do you have topics of yours that were not answered? Maybe we can help on those.\r\n\r\nDo not get me wrong, I do not fully understand what you package aims to do, because the long post above trying to compare it to BinaryBuilder is defiantly AI generated and reads very confusing to me. \r\n\r\nSo if you are learning, that really feel free to ask (a lot of) questions on Discourse, but a package should probably be more carefuly designed - and for example proper tests. Your test suite has a lot of files, but it seems only 5 of them are run? The CI seems to be disabled and there is no code coverage reports. So how can you be sure your code works?\r\n",

You can definitely use it to _review_ hand-written code. Especially if you’re learning!
