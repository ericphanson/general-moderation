      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: Distances, Distributions, KernelFunctions, LambertW, LazySets, MLDataUtils, NearestNeighbors, Parameters, PersistenceDiagrams, PersistenceDiagramsBase, Pipe, Plots, ProgressMeter, Ripserer\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Congratulations on the new package!\r\n\r\nSince \"TDA\" is not a recognizable acronym, can I suggest that you name the package `RobustTopologicalDataAnalysis`? It may seem long, but length isn't really an important factor for Julia package names. Or, if you want to shorten it a little, \"Analysis\" might be redundant. So, maybe `RobustTopologicalData` could work, too?\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep the short \"RobustTDA\" in the \"logo\" in the documentation, you could recommend that people load the package as\r\n\r\n```julia\r\nimport RobustTopologicalDataAnalysis as RobustTDA\r\n```",

      "body": "@goerz Thank you for your suggestion. In the Applied Math and some parts of the ML community, TDA has sort of become the [_de facto_ acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis) for \"Topological Data Analysis\", and it's interesting to hear the perspective from a wider audience. For instance, the two most popular packages for TDA in Python and R also bear the same acronym:\r\n* [Scikit-TDA](https://docs.scikit-tda.org/)\r\n* [R TDA](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TDA/)\r\n\r\nI will definitely reconsider this. Thanks for your comment! ",

      "body": "Yeah, Python enforces absolutely no rules on package naming, whereas in the Julia General Registry, we make a conscious effort to address the wider community of Julia users. This specifically includes [avoiding domain-specific acronyms in package names](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines). A good rule of thumb is whether typing an acronym into Google gives the intended meaning as the first hit. For \"TDA\" this is not the case: Google only finds \"tax deferred annuity\". Even on Wikipedia, [\"topological data analysis\" pretty far down the list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TDA).",
