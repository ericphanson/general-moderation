Even if you have a license (you may), you cannot publish code based on Numerical Recipes under a different license, including the GPL, which is what you've published this under.\r\n\r\nIn short if it's based on Numerical Recipes as you've indicated then this code is not legally open source and cannot be registered in the Julia general registry (or, for that matter, published online at all).\r\n\r\nRegarding the now-deleted Bioinformatics package, the expectation when a package is registered is that the author will not delete the repo since that makes the package uninstallable. I suspect some of the pushback on that package was due to the overly broad name? This package name has a similar issue.",

      "body": "There's a few issues here...\r\n\r\n1. Legal: since I'm very unlikely to ever be in a position to need to implement these methods I took a look at your code and what's in Numerical Recipes and they do not seem notably similar, so that's good. If you say you didn't derive the code from the book then the legal situation is probably fine.\r\n\r\n2. Depth: this is a very small set of somewhat \"toy\" feeling implementations of a kind of random set of algorithms. It has the feel of \"I took these notes while studying and I'm putting them on the Internet.\" Which is great to do, but doesn't require this being a registered package.\r\n\r\n3. Name: `NumericalAlgorithms` is a very broad and suggests some serious aspirations. Are you intending to implement all numerical algorithms? Packages should generally be focused on some specific functionality. If this ends up being a collection of a lot of implementations of algorithms, all the more reason that it should not be a single package, but rather a collection of more specialized packages for each kind of algorithm. Related to the second point, if this is going to be a large collection of algorithms that are meant to serve as a starting point for more specialized implementations, then it would be better to publish but not register since it's not really meant to be used as a package but as a reference.\r\n\r\n2. History: you registered and then deleted `Bioinformatics`; that leaves some concern that the same thing will happen with this package, especially given the previous points. The package `Bioinformatics` had the same problem of having an overly broad name that it could never reasonably live up to and which, even if it did, would not be a good idea for a single package but rather an organization of more specialized packages.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to register something to have it be published and useful. Registering something is a commitment to maintaining it and not deleting it and means that it's something that makes sense for others to reuse. That doesn't seem like it's the case here.",
