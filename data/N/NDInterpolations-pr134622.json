      "body": "> With optional dependencies and package extensions, I think it would be worthwhile to consider an interpolations interface.\r\n\r\nI don't see why we would treat Interpolations.jl as some standard. It has done a fairly poor job at that and has been a noob trap for quite some time. The issue isn't necessarily performance, but a myriad of compatibility that have never been addressed which arise from its design. I think at this time it still doesn't play nice with Symbolics, ModelingToolkit, SparseConnectivityTracer, Enzyme, Mooncake, FillArrays, inside many KA kernels (I think it had issues with Metal last I checked), BLAS-free builds (so effectively julia --trim), etc. It ignores the use of array traits, so it requires sidestepping within codes, and on top of that, the Interpolations.AbstractInterpolation interface is undocumented. It's hard to look at that interface as a standard in comparison to say the DifferentialEquations interpolation interface which has had way more documentation and tutorials written around it, so why not start in that direction?\r\n\r\nThis has been such a longstanding issue that we have a pretty much a blanket response to any Interpolations.jl issue across SciML that if the user gets an issue and we see Interpolations.jl, the first thing to do is to tell them to change that. Because that has a very high likelihood of being the problem. A package of that form is a noob trap. \r\n\r\nAnd it's not something that is easy to fix: it's a fundamental design issue that leads to these general incompatibilities. I think it makes sense given its lineage: it stems from the oldest ages of Julia from before any compiler optimizations tended to exist, and its designs were made to get performance in that regime. While it has dropped some of its more intense specialized macros over time (its v0.5 code was 😅 scary), it still had a design that was geared towards \"I will unroll the loop for you\" CPU-only focus, while also not adopting some of the later styles that came for enhanced performance, such as decreasing allocations in more advanced code use, inlined SIMD finding functions (for example https://github.com/SciML/FindFirstFunctions.jl/blob/main/src/FindFirstFunctions.jl#L6-L62), and caching of search values, each of which have been found to be a larger performance improvement than the kinds of things originally focused on. \r\n\r\nBecause of all of this, Interpolations.jl by its design does not act like a general high-performance Julia package with documented interfaces interfacing with the whole ecosystem, but rather it tends to act more like a wrapped Fortran package which is designed for performance in specific niches and acts nicely mostly on a contained set of types. But it retains its general name because it has been with Julia since the beginning. Thus we have had this need for a very long time to simply start from scratch if we want to achieve the kind of interface we have in other fields. DataInterpolations.jl has been a 1D-specialized version that has got us by for a long time, but now we have a real foundation for the ND-interpolations that we can actually rely on. \r\n\r\nOr if you truly believe Interpolations.jl that Interpolations.jl is not effectively name squatting at this point, then I hope a second interpolation package is a good wake up call that riles up the community to do a complete rewrite of its code and make it work with everything I mentioned above. I'd love to see that, but I've waited about 10 years and it hasn't budged so I don't think there's any merit to a belief it's going to happen any time soon without seeing the PRs start to land. So just like with other such designs in other areas, I'd just leave it alone so it does what it does but then put something new out there with a much larger goal and interface, have Interpolations.jl be one algorithm choice in a more general interface, document its limitations, and just keep moving forward.

Both the number of input and output dimensions can be arbitrarily high. Grid or unstructured multi-point evaluation is built on KernelAbstractions.jl for efficient parallel CPU/GPU evaluation. We currently support Constant, Linear, B-Spline and NURBS interpolation.\n`````\n<!-- END RELEASE NOTES -->\n\n<!-- bf0c69308befbd3ccf2cc956ac8a4671113b158fd87a6d4e741b0173dab051a48f7dc43e593ffff4357bc647a3a835985dce458f687392bac241cbd72951605be6b5171bef1695db89f816bc0fc7020b7f2a15a3dd5d2dd7ea26a6d3fa62f86237bf65dc19203dc142f724ed2c3b52912e2806e00cc607d34bd8622833b93189f3cceec7f7f55b7de6447008a5b86ae19b808117cf4d226321f886806348e0b1cdbfa94c6e5de82c61dcaeca64095e8e -->",
