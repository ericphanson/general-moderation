For development, the CI on GitHub needs registered packages as dependencies.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense, but is best solved by setting up a [LocalRegistry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl) and registering the package there. Even then, I would still rename it to something more specific, though (see below)\r\n\r\n> 2. Share with others. Use cases of these tools are common in my research. Other researchers, at least my colleagues, can simply add and use it without writing their own if it is registered.\r\n\r\nFor use by your colleagues (within your research group), [using a `LocalRegistry` again is the recommended approach](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General#should-i-register-my-package-now). For a wider audience, I would urge you to consider how people would be able to find your package: How would someone looking for the functionality of `geomspace` be able to find your package? There is nothing in the name `NumericalTools` that would give them any hint that that's where to look for such a function. Moreover, there are thousands of people who have their own little helper functions that would have just as much reasoning to create a `NumericalTools` package.\r\n\r\nFor `geomspace`, `linspace`, `logspace`, something like `NumericalSequenceConstructors` might be suitable, but `sqrtm1` and `loginterpolator` do not fit with that. I don't really see how these function can be released in a single coherent package.\r\n\r\n> Since my research field is high energy physics (HEP), how about rename it to `HEPNumericalUtils`?\r\n\r\nThat's hardly any better. There's nothing about this package that really connects it to HEP. You could rename it to something `PhysCXiaNumericalUtils` and put it in a `LocalRegistry`. Or, personally, I wouldn't object to having it in General under that name (although it still violates the guidelines against \"personal collection of utility functions\", so maybe others would object, but I don't see the harm in having packages with such highly distinctive names in General)",
