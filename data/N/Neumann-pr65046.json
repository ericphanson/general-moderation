Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to Lehmann. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I can change the name, of course - but I'm a little puzzled by why this particular package name is sufficiently special that it warrants this? There's countless other packages in the ecosystem that are named after some person - with that person having many distinct contributions (to mention a few: Hilbert.jl, Lehmann.jl, Turing.jl, Fermi.jl, Erdos.jl, Keldysh.jl, etc. - and I have a few as well: Brillouin.jl and Bravais.jl).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what makes Neumann particularly special in this regard? This was only flagged initially due to Levenstein similarity with Lehmann.jl - not due to anything related to boundary conditions etc.\r\n\r\nThis is a small package so the name doesn't matter terribly to me; but I'm wondering if there is something broader about package naming policy I've missed here?\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
