      "body": "Wecome @nicomignoni!\r\n\r\nGenerally in the julia space, when people hear \"vectorization\", they're thinking of [SIMD vectorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data). I'll admit when I saw this go up for registration, my first thought was that it was related to that, and then I thought \"Oh, maybe this is vectorization in the sense used by Numpy / Matlab people for what we call 'broadcast\". It took me a while to realize this was for stacking vectors together and assigning each component a name for some reason. \r\n\r\nDefinitely not a 'hard requirement', but I'd perhaps recommend choosing another name that is perhaps a bit clearer to readers what it's for. I think even something like \r\n* NamedVecCat\r\n* ComponentVecCat\r\n\r\ncould make it a significantly clearer, since `vec` is already the julia function for making a linear vector out of  `N` dimensional structures, and `cat` is the term we use for con**cat**enation.\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nIn terms of functionality, I'll also point out that this package has **significant** overlap with the [ComponentArrays.jl](https://github.com/SciML/ComponentArrays.jl) package. Here's how you'd do the [examples from the README](https://nicomignoni.github.io/NamedVectorizations.jl/dev/) with ComponentArrays using essentially identical syntax:\r\n```julia\r\njulia> using ComponentArrays\r\n\r\njulia> begin\r\n           A = [4 5; 2 1]\r\n           b = [9; -2]\r\n           c = 7\r\n\r\n           ca = ComponentArray(A=A, b=b, c=c)\r\n       end\r\nComponentVector{Int64}(A = [4 5; 2 1], b = [9, -2], c = 7)\r\n```\r\n```julia\r\njulia> ca.A\r\n2×2 reshape(view(::Vector{Int64}, 1:4), 2, 2) with eltype Int64:\r\n 4  5\r\n 2  1\r\n\r\njulia> ca.b\r\n2-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 5:6) with eltype Int64:\r\n  9\r\n -2\r\n\r\njulia> ca.c\r\n7\r\n```\r\n```julia\r\njulia> Vector(ca)\r\n7-element Vector{Int64}:\r\n  4\r\n  2\r\n  5\r\n  1\r\n  9\r\n -2\r\n  7\r\n```\r\n```julia\r\njulia> getaxes(ca)\r\n(Axis(A = ViewAxis(1:4, ShapedAxis((2, 2))), b = ViewAxis(5:6, Shaped1DAxis((2,))), c = 7),)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there anything you can do with this package that one can't do in ComponentArrays.jl or can't be easily added to ComponentArrays.jl with a PR? There's generally no problem with having multiple packages with significant overlap, but when there is, it's important to clarify why a new package is needed in this space and in what circumstances it should be used over the older pre-existing packages. \r\n\r\nSo if there is something that makes this shine relative to ComponentArrays, I would ask you to add something about that to your README / docs.

      "body": "Hello @MasonProtter and thank you for the quick review!\r\n\r\nI apologize for the documentation being extremely terse, `NamedVectorization.jl` is a small package that I need for a larger project about variational inequalities (VIs), but I find it useful as standalone for some of my optimization and mathematical modelling needs. \r\n\r\nIn the optimization / VIs / convex analysis areas, [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectorization_(mathematics)) is what people means by *vectorization*, although I agree that it might be confused with different but homonymous concepts. What about `NamedVec`? It is available on the registry, and it is maybe a bit easier to pronounce than `NamedVecCat` :) . \r\n\r\nAs for the overlap with `ComponentArrays`, the main difference is that `NamedVectorizations` tries to preserve the `NV` structure \"as much as possible\" falling back to an `Array` only when the `layout` changes or becomes ambiguous. `ComponentArrays` seems to do it for most cases: going back to the quickstart example, we have\r\n```julia\r\nusing NamedVectorizations, ComponentArrays\r\n\r\nA = [4 5; 2 1]\r\nb = [9; -2]\r\nc = 7\r\n\r\nca = ComponentArray(A=A, b=b, c=c)\r\nnv = NV(A=A, b=b, c=c)\r\n```\r\nThe `ComponentArray` structure is preserved for scalar broadcasting and `vcat` (when the  `layout` is different)\r\n```julia\r\njulia> 2ca\r\nComponentVector{Int64}(A = [4 5; 2 1], b = [9, -2], c = 7)\r\n\r\njulia> ca .+ 1\r\nComponentVector{Int64}(A = [5 6; 3 2], b = [10, -1], c = 8)\r\n\r\njulia> ca2 = ComponentArray(d=[2 3; 0 -5], e=3, f=[1, 3]);\r\njulia> vcat(ca, ca2) \r\nComponentVector{Int64}(A = [4 5; 2 1], b = [9, -2], c = 7, d = [2 3; 0 -5], e = 3, f = [1, 3])\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever, in case of, e.g., matrix multiplication, this is not the case anymore\r\n```julia\r\nM = rand(7, 7)\r\n\r\njulia> M * ca\r\n7-element Vector{Float64}:\r\n 20.544664037807415\r\n 17.19027701311383\r\n  9.691286477849847\r\n 16.50403192545688\r\n 19.77931411723072\r\n  8.254524946757265\r\n 12.704243794353575\r\n```\r\nWith an `NV`, instead, the vectorized structure is preserved, as the `layout` remains unaltered\r\n\r\n```julia\r\njulia> M * nv\r\n7-element NV{Float64} with layout: \r\n├ A: Matrix 2x2, [1-4]\r\n├ b: 2-element Vector, [5-6]\r\n└ c: Number, [7]:\r\n 20.544664037807415\r\n 17.19027701311383\r\n  9.691286477849847\r\n 16.50403192545688\r\n 19.77931411723072\r\n  8.254524946757265\r\n 12.704243794353575\r\n```\r\nIf we were to multiply by a rectangular matrix, the result would fall back to a `Vector`, as the `layout` would be altered in length\r\n```julia\r\nM = rand(5, 7)\r\n\r\njulia> M * nv\r\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\r\n 13.32959886623553\r\n 16.728508642760282\r\n 18.20024574308967\r\n 12.139114738780965\r\n 15.120611176597235\r\n```\r\nThis is the only difference (as far as I can tell for now) that makes `NamedVectorizations` preferable for me over `ComponentArray`, although I will try to open a PR on the matter before continuing developing `NamedVectorizations` and re-applying for registering. There is also a future line of work for making `NV` preservable under `ChainRules`; if I build up enough differences with `ComponentArray`, I will try to register `NamedVectorizations` (or `NamedVecCat`) again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
