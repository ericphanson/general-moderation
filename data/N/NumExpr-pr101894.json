      "body": "@gdalle Thank you for your feedback on the proposed package name. I understand your concerns regarding its length and similarity to existing names. However, I’d like to offer some considerations in favor of retaining the chosen name, “NumExpr”:\r\n\r\n1. Brevity and Functionality: A shorter name facilitates easier function overloading without the need for additional aliasing logic. This enhances usability and code readability, which are core tenets of Julia’s design philosophy.\r\n2. Conventional Abbreviations: “Num” and “Expr” are widely recognized abbreviations for “Numerical” and “Expression,” respectively. This naming convention is intuitive for users familiar with mathematical and programming terminologies, ensuring the package’s purpose is immediately clear.\r\n3. Distinctive Functionality: While our package shares a name resemblance with the Python ‘numexpr’, it is not a port nor directly inspired by it. Our work is poised to introduce a powerful backend for reactive mathematical computations, distinguishing itself in functionality and scope. The name “NumExpr” succinctly reflects our package’s focus on numerical expressions, aligning with its innovative approach.\r\n\r\nOur intention is not to confuse but to maintain a clear and functional identity within the Julia ecosystem.\r\n[noblock]",

NumericalExpressions is a better name than NumExpr for the General registry.\r\n\r\n2. In Julia, the abbreviation `Expr` refers most commonly to `Base.Expr`. This package is for working with numerical expressions, rather than the Julia `Expr` type, so using the `Expr` abbreviation is confusing/possibly misleading.\r\n\r\n3.

Community Consensus: Getting FrancescAlted's nod was about ensuring community buy-in. If that's not a key factor, what is?\r\n2. Guideline Timing: The new guidelines came in mid-discussion. They should apply to future packages, not retroactively affect ours. Changing rules midway shouldn't impact already submitted proposals.\r\n3. Practical Naming: \"Expr\" in our name is practical and specific. With clear documentation, any confusion is minimal.\r\n\r\nLet's aim for a balanced and fair approach, respecting the collaborative spirit and the timing of guideline updates.\r\n[noblock]",

But the more relevant community is the Julia community, and there's no consensus there. Actually, there is: the consensus in the community is that you should rename the package, but you are refusing to do so.\r\n\r\nSo at this point, the question is whether there's a maintainer who feels \"the author should have the last word\" outweighs the interests of the community.\r\n\r\n> Guideline Timing: The new guidelines came in mid-discussion.\r\n\r\nBeing the cause of a new community guideline is about the strongest rebuke you could possibly get.\r\n\r\n> Let's aim for a balanced and fair approach,\r\n\r\nYou've not given an inch here, so I don't see how this is \"balanced\".

The package naming conventions are *deliberately* different from the conventions in these other languages. Different languages have different conventions, and you should follow the conventions of the language you are using. `NumericalExpressions` would not be a good name for a Python or C++ package, but it would, for a Julia package.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, using full names hinders creativity and makes the namespace limited and ugly.\r\n\r\nIt is the strong consensus of the Julia community that we want packages to be named that way (with some specific exceptions). We still very much allow for creative names; not every package name has to be of the explicit form of `NumericalExpressions`. But `NumExpr` is in no way an example of a creative package name. It is simply a *short* name, which does not match the guidelines.\r\n\r\nYour ideas on package naming are just not compatible with the General registry, which is why every package registration coming out of your organization has been problematic. If you are unwilling to adapt, please create a `LocalRegistry` for your organization that meets your expectations.\r\n",
