      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the following guidelines for auto-merging:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an uppercase letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, ends in a lowercase letter. **Important note: It is okay to have a package name that ends in an uppercase letter. However, you will need to wait until a registry maintainer manually approves the name.**\n- Version number is not 0.0.1, 0.1.0, 1.0.0, or X.0.0\n- The following dependencies do not have a compat entry that has an upper bound: NNlib, PaddedViews, ProgressMeter, julia. You may find [CompatHelper](https://github.com/bcbi/CompatHelper.jl) helpful for keeping your compat entries up-to-date.Note: If your package works for the current version `x.y.z` of a dependency `foo`, then a compat entry `foo = x.y.z` implies a compatibility upper bound for packages following semver. You can additionally include earlier versions your package is compatible with. See https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/compatibility/ for details.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",
