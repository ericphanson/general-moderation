I can do `NNetSauce`, I guess it'd be  100% CamelCase that way. \r\n\r\nRight now, I'm struggling a little bit (maybe because i'm relatively new to it) with naming functions'  arguments. Trying to achieve this [https://thierrymoudiki.github.io/blog/2023/11/27/python/r/julia/quasirandomizednn/julia-nnetsauce#](https://thierrymoudiki.github.io/blog/2023/11/27/python/r/julia/quasirandomizednn/julia-nnetsauce#), but I'm getting errors such as 'named parameter `n_hidden_features` not found'. Any suggestion is welcome. Thanks. ",
