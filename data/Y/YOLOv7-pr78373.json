Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to YOLO. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

It is very different from https://github.com/IanButterworth/YOLO.jl which implements an older version of the YOLO object classifier using different techniques. Writing the package as \"yolov7\" or \"Yolo7\" would work on the name distance, but would look weird since the idea is to use the capital YOLO as originally made by the papers.",

      "body": "@gabrielpreviato, I'm not sure why it isn't mentioned in the auto-response above, but from the Registry README:\r\n\r\n> If you for some reason can't (or won't) adhere to the guidelines you will have to wait for a human to review/merge the pull request. You can contact a human in the #pkg-registration channel in the official Julia Slack to expedite this process.\r\n\r\nYou may need to mention this PR over there to draw attention to it. General gets a lot of PR's, and PR's with posts lacking the `[noblock]` tag (mentioned in the auto-response) tend to indicate that the package isn't yet ready for registration, so it's possible this slipped between the cracks.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong opinion either way on naming. Without any domain experience, both packages seem to me to be wrappers for different versions of the same software, but it looks like the prior hasn't seen any maintenance in a few years.\r\n\r\n-Mike (Julia community member, not a moderator)\r\n[noblock]",
