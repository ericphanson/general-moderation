      "body": "Can I use a name like CTDescriptions (for ControlToolboxDescriptions)? \r\n\r\nIn the future control toolbox, there will be solvers for optimal control problems but also methods to compute flows of ode (based on DifferentialEquations package), interfaces to NLP solvers (as `JuMP`), interfaces to NLE solvers (as `MINPACK` or `NLSolve`) but also a personal differential path following method to solve a one-parameter family of NLE equations. \r\n\r\nThe solvers will be called via a `solve` method as in the `CommonSolve` package but with an additional \"description\" of the method that will be called by the solver. For instance, if you want to solve an optimal control problem via a descent method with backtracking, with an optional argument `grid` set to `my_grid`, you will do\r\n\r\n```julia\r\nsol = solve(ocp, :descent, :backtracking, grid=my_grid)\r\n# or\r\nsol = solve(ocp, (:descent, :backtracking), grid=my_grid)\r\n# or\r\nsol = solve(ocp, :backtracking, grid=my_grid) # backtracking is only valid for descent method\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis concept of description will be used also for all the other solvers, so it is quite general but I understand that it will be more appropriate to give a more specific name. If `CTDescriptions` is better, I can change.\r\n\r\n",
