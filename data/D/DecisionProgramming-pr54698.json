Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: DataFrames, JuMP, PrettyTables, StatsBase\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Internally, it relies on mathematical optimization. Decision models can be embedded within other optimization models.\n<!-- bf0c69308befbd3ccf2cc956ac8a46712550b79fc9bfb5e4edf8f833f05f4c18b06eddad8845b45beb9f45c2b8020dd66360128d9f9ef64aebf81c563b8c4e8d03b974908a87de7ac78634700538b1edcd432caf4d1bc6f1453fa9fb9cbf5fc9982f3da412c496574b7aa64f8a50749caab91153779225e8b59a802164b0bad10a626653d9750c335d4bf786b9484e5408df98e0f73d098eefb18fc459577c045a584c774c4be3d11bede71f88864d85a76f34d6f7d5081bdc629ca82cddaba3edfbf1741c46ebd753505f91f87dab6f79b609369e061d1340df7f2362391f9f2bd60eac8fb7fa3a98a9b450dfefe4a6 -->",
