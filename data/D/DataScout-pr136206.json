      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

As long as you keep the version number the same, then any updates can update the existing registration PR instead of creating a new one.\r\n\r\nOne core aspect of this (both for the initial registration and later releases): Do not create [release tags](https://github.com/liyakhathshaik/DataScout.jl/tags) before the registration has been merged. This is exactly because you can't be absolutely sure that the commit you are submitting for registration will pass all checks. It may have to be amended, in which case, the tag would have to be re-created to reflect the actual release. Deleting and recreating tags \"rewrites history\" and can lead to all kinds of problems and should be avoided. You can create tags manually _after_ a release has been merged into the registry. Or, and this is _strongly_ recommended for any package hosted on GitHub: Set up the [TagBot workflow](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/TagBot) to handle the creation of tags automatically.\r\n\r\n> I’ll make sure to include proper docs right after the module is merged.\r\n\r\nThe General registry is for sharing packages with the wider community when they are ready for use. That requires enough documentation to get started with the package. So, as a rule, we ask that the documentation is added _before_ the package is submitted for registration.",
