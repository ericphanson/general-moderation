      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to FEHM. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I apologize for the inconvenience, but I would appreciate an exception to the naming conventions for this package.\r\n\r\nThis package is a simulator that is the successor to a code developed in my group at LANL called [FEHM](https://fehm.lanl.gov). The name of this package was chosen to reflect that legacy. This new code is implemented using the principles of differentiable programming (DP). So, this is why \"DP\" is prepended to the name \"FEHM\" to get \"DPFEHM\". When people ask what \"DPFEHM\" stands for, I tell them it doesn't stand for anything. This is partly because the original \"FEHM\" ostensibly stands for \"Finite Element Heat and Mass\", but became a misnomer over the years as it mainly uses finite volume methods (as does DPFEHM). So, DPFEHM is really a proper noun rather than an acronym.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Damerau-Levenshtein conflict with [FEHM.jl](https://github.com/zemjulia/FEHM.jl) arises because there is a Julia package (of which I made the most recent and initial commits) for the underlying [FEHM](https://fehm.lanl.gov) simulator (which written in Fortran). I think it is unlikely that the proximity in namespace will cause problems.",
