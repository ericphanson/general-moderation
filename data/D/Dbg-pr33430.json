Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least five characters long\n- Package name similar to 5 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Org. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 1.97 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to Pkg. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to Cbc. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to Ogg. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  5. Similar to DSP. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",
