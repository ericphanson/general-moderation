      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Thank you for submitting your package. However, it does not seem ready for registration yet. Please see the [FAQ](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#should-i-register-my-package-now).\r\n\r\nIn the tagged commit, the package is empty. Since we do not allow placeholder registrations, it will not be possible to merge that. More generally, the requirements for registering an initial `v0.1` are:\r\n\r\n* Must have a name that is appropriate for the scope of the package\r\n* Must have some non-trivial functionality (no \"placeholder\" packages)\r\n* Must have a README that explains the purpose of the package and gives a basic usage example (or a link to documentation that is sufficient to figure out how to get started)\r\n\r\nSince you don't have anything in the README, it's unclear whether the current package name is appropriate.\r\n\r\nWith 1.0, in addition to that,\r\n\r\n* Must define the stable API. That generally means _complete_ documentation.\r\n* Must have tests with reasonable coverage (on the order of 80%). Otherwise, there's no way to know if the package actually implements its API correctly\r\n* Should somewhat reasonably fill the described scope of the package. No _major_ gaps in functionality.\r\n\r\nYour package is clearly not at the 1.0 stage yet, so you should register it with an initial version 0.1 instead, after adding more functionality and a more complete README.\r\n",
