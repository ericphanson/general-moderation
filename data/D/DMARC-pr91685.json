      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I am writing to request the approval of the `DMARC.jl` package name for our Julia package. The name `DMARC.jl` does not strictly adhere to the established package naming conventions, where names usually start with an uppercase letter and consist of ASCII alphanumerics only. However, I kindly request an exception to this rule, as the name `DMARC.jl` is an industry acronym for \"Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance.\" Acronyms like DMARC are often capitalized and widely recognized within their respective domains.\r\n\r\nWe considered alternative names, such as `DMARCParser.jl`, but we weren't sure it would receive approval either. Having the package name as `DMARC.jl` allows us potential scope to expand the functionality of the package in the future while maintaining a recognizable and intuitive name.\r\n\r\nChoosing `DMARC.jl` as the package name serves to clearly and accurately represent its purpose as an implementation related to DMARC, a critical standard in email authentication and security. We believe this name provides a strong foundation for potential growth and development of this package, making it a valuable addition to the Julia community.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this request.",
