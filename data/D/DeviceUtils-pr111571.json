I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Is there any chance we could come up with a more descriptive name? In `LuxDeviceUtils.jl`, `Lux` was the descriptive part of the package name, and the name was okay for an *internal* dependency of `Lux.jl`. But without the `Lux`, neither `Device` nor `Utils` really have any meaning. It's not clear that \"Device\" refers to GPU/CPU devices, and \"Utils\" only makes sense in relation to another package that utilizes those utils. So, maybe something like `GPUDataDevices`?",

While the scope has been broadened from Lux, certain conversion semantics makes more sense in the machine learning context.",
