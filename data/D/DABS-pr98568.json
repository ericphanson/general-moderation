      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- I was not able to install the package (i.e. `Pkg.add(\"DABS\")` failed). See the AutoMerge logs for details.\n- Cloning repository failed.\n- Could not check license because could not access package code. Perhaps the `can_download_code` check failed earlier.\n- `src` directory not found\n- I was not able to load the package (i.e. `import DABS` failed). See the AutoMerge logs for details.\n- Package name similar to 7 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to CAOS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 1.58 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  2. Similar to GAMS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 2.40 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  3. Similar to COBS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 2.44 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n  4. Similar to DAQP. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  5. Similar to DASSL. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  6. Similar to AWS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  7. Similar to AES. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",
