The .julia-configs folder is where all the Julia code for such will go, and later likely 100s of commits will be given to just adding Julia compatibility for my app.",

As many devs have scientific computing projects in which they want to add Julia compatibility to their pre-existing project but don't want to make a standalone repo for their package. A good example are lots of statistical libraries and collections would have 1000s of repos if they made a repo for every time they integrate compatibility for a specific package manager or language.",
