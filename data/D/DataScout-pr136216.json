      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "This is still a little too light on documentation to really be suitable for registration yet. As mentioned in https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/136206#issuecomment-3170680897, if you delete the [`v0.1.1` tag](https://github.com/liyakhathshaik/DataScout.jl/releases/tag/v0.1.1), you could add more commits and retrigger the registration the same way you originally triggered it which keeping the version number the same.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, I recommend setting up a full [Documenter-based](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/) documentation that includes a formal API (the docstrings of all public functions in the package). Before a 1.0 release, or for smaller packages, it's fine to put all the documentation in the `README.md`. Do make sure that it provides enough information to use the package, and also, that you use [proper (Markdown) formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)",
