The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 9 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to Luna.

However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.

I'm in no position to set any kind of \"policy\" on this. In the past, I've pushed back against some other toy packages, but those did end up being merged. In my personal opinion, I don't think these toy packages are a great fit for General.  It doesn't do much for such a package to be registered. And you could have an infinite number of packages that print quotes from different works of fiction. I think these are fun, but do they need to be registered?\r\n\r\n>> I can’t see this as a dependency for any other package\r\n>\r\n> This cannot be the criterion, can it?  Surely General has lots of enduser packages…\r\n\r\nNot a criterion by itself, I would say, but maybe in combination with other factors.\r\n\r\nI don't know. For most existing \"end user\" packages, they'd still be a dependency in some `Project.toml` in a \"serious\" context. I don't really see that for `Dune`. I would assume it's something people might want to set up in their `startup.jl` for amusements, very much like the classic `fortune` utility in Unix. For such as case, does it make any difference whether the installation instructions are \"Run `Pkg.add(\"Dune\")` or `Pkg.add(url=\"...\")`? Or, if you want to have a bunch of similar such packages and make installing them really easy, put them in a personal `LocalRegistry`?\r\n\r\nActually, I'd be fine with a registered \"Fortunes.jl\" package that reimplements the classic fortune system, but not as much with a different package for any work of fiction.\r\n\r\nIs it worth taking up Dune-themed package names for this? These could otherwise still be a nice \"less systematic\" name for some, I don't know, ecology framework.\r\n\r\nP.S.: I've asked on `#pkg-registration` on Slack whether we have any sort of community consensus on this question",
