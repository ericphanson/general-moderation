      "body": "Agreed - the package would probably be better called `PlasmoGraphsMakie` or something similar.  Ending with `Plots` usually implies a relation to `Plots.jl` which is probably not wanted.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, @dlcole3 have you looked into the monorepo pattern (https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl/issues/1251)?  It would probably make it easier for you to centralize development as well.  Having this in its own repo and making changes to the underlying data structure is pretty painful - we had that same issue in Makie before Pkg started supporting monorepos.",

      "body": "@goerz @asinghvi17  I like the idea of calling it `PlasmoDataPlots.jl` rather than `DataGraphPlots.jl`. Since it has a dependency on both `Plots.jl` and `Makie.jl` (`Plots.jl` is used for undirected graphs and `Makie.jl` is used for directed graphs), I am inclined to keep the `Plots` ending rather than `Makie` ending since I think I want it to be clear that it is a plotting package. This would also be somewhat consistent with `Plasmo.jl` which has an accompanying plotting package called `PlasmoPlots.jl` (see [here](https://github.com/plasmo-dev)). ",
