      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

My thinking was that it could be used to define lazy views over any generic iterable, which has use cases outside of machine learning. For example, it could be used for data engineering or statistical analysis. Maybe modifying the package description could help clarify this?",

      "body": "Maybe. It would be good to get some more community feedback on the name (probably best done on Slack). I’m not even quite sure what I would really expect of a `DataViews` package. Probably some kind of query language on top of DataFrames. But if you type “DataViews” into Google, there is *a lot* of “prior art” with different contexts. My recommendation would be to try to avoid the confusion and to come up with a more unique and descriptive name.",
