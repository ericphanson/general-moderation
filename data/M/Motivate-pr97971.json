      "body": "[noblock] Nothing wrong with this package, but it doesn't seem like something that other packages would need as a dependency. That makes it much less important to be registered: https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General#do-i-need-to-register-a-package-to-install-it\r\n\r\nI'm just slightly skeptical that the name is so generic, as it seems more like a \"personal tool\" (not that others wouldn't want some motivation, too). If the name was less generic (`MotivateMarkus`, or maybe even just `MotivateMe`), I don't think it would raise any flags.",

      "body": "[noblock] Thanks for the comment. I agree, it is probably not a high priority package. However, I plan to build this package to include a much larger set of quotes, more options, and topics. It could be a fun tool for easter eggs in other dependencies.\r\n\r\nI agree, that changing the name to MotivateMe is a good idea. Do I need to start the registering process all over again if I change the name?",
