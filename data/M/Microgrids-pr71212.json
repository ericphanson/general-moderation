Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- There is no compat entry for `julia`.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

However, I see two subcases:\r\n\r\n- if first trigger is done using a comment `@JuliaRegistrator register` in a PR, like I did the second time ([Microgrids-X/Microgrids.jl#2](https://github.com/Microgrids-X/Microgrids.jl/issues/2) → which created PR  [#71214,](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/71214)), then I see how to retrigger: it's indeed \"simply\" about adding a new comment `@JuliaRegistrator register`.\r\n- However, using juliahub.com web interface for the first trigger, I didn't find a \"retrigger\" interface. The only form I could find was to start a *new registration* PR\r\n  - Or is it the case that filling the new package registration form a second time in fact just makes a retrigger on the first PR?\r\n\r\n",
