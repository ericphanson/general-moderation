      "body": "[noblock] Definitely plural. But whether or not to keep the MCP acronym is up to you. It's not a _requirement_ that _every_ acronym in a package name needs to be written out. One good criterion for whether an acronym is \"common\": does Google return the correct hit as the first (and first few) results? In the case of MCP: definitely. I would say that in many cases, combining an acronym with a non-acronym word is sufficient in a package name. `MCPClients` tells me the package provides a client for something called the MCP protocol. That's good enough for me to give me an idea for what the package is about without any prior knowledge. Beyond that, if I don't know what MCP is (and, in fact, I don't), I'm probably not in the market for that package.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go with a long name like `ModelContextProtocolClients`, that's ok, but you shouldn't feel obligated to. At least I would be 100% comfortable with the name `MCPClients`. And it does have the benefit of following the guideline that \"`MCPClients` provides the `MCPClient` type\", which `ModelContextProtocolClients` does not. So, actually, I would slightly _prefer_ `MCPClients`.\r\n\r\nSo, you would definitely have the last word on this question. Choose the name you are most comfortable with.",

This is entirely within the package author's authority to decide.\r\n\r\nAnd, just to be clear: I don't think `MCP.jl` would have been acceptable (even ignoring the other guidelines, such as minimum length), and indeed would have recommended `ModelContextProtocol.jl`. But a somewhat widely used acronym in its dominant meaning (according to the first page on Google) _combined_ with other words that provide additional context should generally be fair game for package name. Without that, you quickly end up with _absurdly_ long package names. Plus, acronyms _can_ be useful to provide recognizability. If the context is clear, then using an acronym makes it obvious I'm talking about the widely understood concept behind that acronym. Whereas writing out the acronym, it's not always clear whether that's actually referring to the same concept, or is just a \"coincidence\".\r\n\r\nI'm just not nearly as opposed to acronyms as package names as some others, and definitely not to acronyms as _part_ of package names. What we don't want is indecipherable domain-specific three-letter acronyms as package names, like the recent [JAC](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/129915). But otherwise, we should maybe loosen up a bit and decide on a case-by-case basis.",

      "body": "> is there a chance to rename a package or remove a package from the registry?\r\n\r\nThere is not. Once a package is registered, it's permanent. See also the [FAQ](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#how-do-i-remove-a-package-or-version-from-the-registry).\r\n\r\nAlso, I didn't actually realize until earlier today that this is the \"MCP\" that's been all the rage on the internet during last couple of months. From that perspective, and with the package naming tradition of descriptive package names that we've ended up with in the General registry, registering a package implies a bit of a responsibility. For general names, there is implication that a package should live up to the expectation of its name. So for a name like `MCPClients` (or `ModelContextProtocolClients`), there's the implication that it should handle everything in the scope of \"MCP clients\". When \"MCP clients\" are a hot topic, that means you should expect to be around to manage contributions to the package. Or, ultimately, if you ever move on, hand off the package to a new maintainer.\r\n\r\nThis is just a general comment, I'm not familiar enough with the subject matter to say anything about whether your package is broad enough in scope to fit the name.\r\n\r\n> I am thinking about this some more...\r\n\r\nLet me know what you decide. There's a fair number of comments now on this PR, and it might be a bit of a hassle to mark everything as [noblock]. But I can apply an override tag for that, if you tell me to and nobody has any strong objection.",

Until then, using direct installation or a [LocalRegistry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl) should be perfectly sufficient.

      "body": "Yeah, I think the ModelContextProtocol.jl is very nice library but for me I always force simpler code architect and pursue the simplest possible form of each algorithm (relying mostly on Base structs and so), so I am too much opinionated on that side and I don't want to write my code in that lengthy way. \r\n\r\nSo I think this package will be for \"reaching the MCP logic with the simplest way and with low LOC\" and it just wouldn't be cool to merge them. \r\n\r\nAs during my career I always realized too structured or overgeneralized stuffs/code were always dropped as time went by (for many reason) and I am always trying to make in its minimal form and the simplest way (sometimes even sacrificing LOC for understandability) to in general when it comes to using the code I want to minimize the cognitive load for everyone to work with it. \r\nAlso I totally feel that the python cannot succeed due to the burden of their boilerpates and complexity as the pacakges mature there. (It sounds good till you don't come back to the same package after 5 years passed... then you realize that you don't want to touch those code :D , and usually I write pretty clean code... so I don't even want to talk about when you have to work with someone else code XD )",
