In this case, `MORWiki` is the standard capitalization of this name (much like the `Base.IOBuffer` type).\r\n\r\nIf you rename your package to `MORWiki.jl` folks who are used to Julia package naming conventions will be able to remember and guess it's name much more easily.",

However, the preferred way to cite the MOR Wiki is \"MORwiki\" (https://morwiki.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/morwiki/index.php/MOR_Wiki:About). I don't have a strong opinion, but would prefer if package and preferred citation are the same. Let me discuss this internally and get back to you afterwards.",
