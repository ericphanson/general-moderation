      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) which are not met ❌\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- JLL packages are only allowed to depend on Pkg, Libdl, Artifacts, JLLWrappers, LazyArtifacts, TOML, MPIPreferences and other JLL packages\n\n## 3. *Needs action*: here's what to do next\n\n1. Please try to update your package to conform to these guidelines. The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\n2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\n\nIf you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [public Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) for better visibility.\n\n## 4. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "JLLs don't follow the same rules as normal packages, for instance there's no 3 day waiting period for new packages.  Most JLLs, generated by [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil), are automatically merged 15 minutes after being opened here.  This is because the maintainers of Yggdrasil (which includes myself) are trusted to maintain the \"_jll\" namespace of Julia packages, and if something gets merged in Yggdrasil, it is automatically incorporated here without extra scrutiny.  Therefore, I merged this PR soon after opening it.\r\n\r\nThis JLL was generated via [BinaryBuilder2](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder2.jl) and as such has [a dependency](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilder2.jl/tree/main/LazyJLLWrappers.jl) that doesn't pass the JLL auto-merge criteria (at least, until someone gets around to [merging this PR](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/RegistryCI.jl/pull/571)).\r\n\r\n[I also did this for `Mingw_jll`](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/111897#issuecomment-2269923943), which had the exact same issue.  Getting these packages registered is very helpful for making forward progress on BinaryBuilder2.",

      "body": "Okay, thanks for the clarification! Since I don't have experience with JLLs I generally ignore anything related to that, or rather, I almost never see anything JLL-related pop up here. There's usually an entirely different process for JLL packages, right? Out of curiosity, why did this package show up in the new packages feed when other JLLs do not?\r\n\r\nI was just a little concerned about the self-merge, since that recently came up as a problem for a normal (non-JLL) package. For normal packages, I've advocated that nobody should manually merge registrations that they have any kind of stake in. That may not apply to the JLL namespace, though. If it's not a problem, then it's not a problem :-)",

I wasn't aware of that channel, but my guess is that Logan has set that up to ignore JLL packages through some criterion that this PR does not satisfy, e.g. because the initiating user is not `@jlbuild`, perhaps.",
