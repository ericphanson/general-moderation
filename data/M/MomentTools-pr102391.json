      "body": "[noblock]. It's just that \"Tools\" is an extremely non-descriptive word. I'd generally avoid it in package names, except maybe for packages that directly relate to a framework of packages (similar to how \"Base\" is used: you could have \"Tools\" for utilities shared by the packages in a specific organization).\r\n\r\nSo `MomentTools` doesn't really give much of an indication of what this package is about. My suggestion was based on the sentence in the README \"This a Julia package for solving polynomial optimization problems, via moment matrix relaxations\".\r\n\r\n> There is a package MomentOpt\r\n\r\nSo then how does this package compare to that package? That might be something to mention in the README, and something to take into account when choosing a more descriptive package name.",
