Thanks for your response and the update!\r\nThe already registered package MathieuFunctions doesn't enable you to plot the Mathieu functions themselves and do any computations with them. It appears to only allow the characteristic values to be calculated and plotted. So I couldn't use them for my own project, and had to write it myself. I need the periodic Mathieu functions as a basis set for expanding the wave-function in a test study.\r\nHowever, I was focused on my own calculations and I didn't think about adding my code to the already available MathieuFunctions package. I agree that it is a good idea to do a PR to that directly and avoid cluttering the libraries in Julia and keep things neat. I'll try that and if it doesn't get pulled soon, I'll apply the fixes you mentioned and try registering the package again.\r\n\r\nWell, all is not lost though: this whole thing fished a bug out of the registration process, which is a plus for Julia lang development!\r\n",
