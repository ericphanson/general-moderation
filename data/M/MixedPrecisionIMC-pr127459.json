      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "It seems like the README is not well-formatted, and the badges to the documentation at the bottom of the page are currently broken.\r\n\r\nEspecially for a version `v1.0`, I would consider a complete and somewhat polished documentation to be essential. If your are following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), you are indicating that your package has a stable API, and that you will be keeping track of breaking/non-breaking changes, going forward. That requires a clear specification of what the official API is. My recommendation for that is to have auto-generated API documentation via [Documenter](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/). I also recommend having a reasonably complete test suite for a v1.0 version. Without that, it is quite hard to identify breaking changes in future PRs.\r\n\r\nSo I would recommend to either bring the documentation into better shape, or to start with an initial pre-1.0 version. That would give you time to polish the package more, and then you can tag v1.0 at any point later, as soon as the package meets that expectations people would generally have for a \"stable\" package.\r\n\r\nIn any case, using proper Markdown formatting in the README is properly a low-hanging fruit",
