      "body": "It is in fact a simple implementation of Metropolis-Hastings. At first, i wrote it for learning purposes and when I began working on a serious project, I actually checked out AdvancedMH. I found out, nonetheless, that this implementation is actually faster! Using `@benchmark`, the usage example in the README of AdvancedMH takes about 72ms, while the same example, but in this implementation, only takes 55ms. Add that to a much simpler interface, and that it worked for everything that I tried (mainly Monte Carlo integration), I actually prefer using this implementation.\r\n\r\nWhat prompted me do add it to the General Registry is that I want to use it in another package that I'm developing, and there are known problems to add an unregistered package as a dependency.",

I would also recommend adding / extending the documentation a bit, including a discussion of how this implementation differs from `AdvancedMH` (which would also be where you could show off a benchmark comparing the two packages). Such in-depth documentation isn't a prerequisite for registration, obviously.",
