      "body": "## 1. Introduction\n\nHello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). Meeting these guidelines is only required for the pull request to be **merged automatically**. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 2. New package registration\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 3. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 4. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

I haven't came up with a good way to speak to the use of SII because of this; anything with \"Symbolic\" makes it sound like this library is doing something symbolic itself. SymbolicallyIndexedModelTesting is accurate, but slightly absurd.\r\n\r\nI think that saying it's for MTK is more accurate than not but then the problem there is disambiguating it from things that are more properly part of MTK like MTKSL. It seems like a least-worst option?",

DynamicModelTesting is an idea... but it implies that it's dynamically testing models which is also not accurate. DynamicalModelTesting? I don't really support PDEs at the moment so it's fairly accurate, and it disambiguates what this does from statistical model testing.\r\n\r\nWait no, that has ambiguity issues with DynamicalSystems.jl, which I don't support now...\r\n\r\nThis kind of argues for \"proper name\" but I am even more terrible at coming up with those.",

You can solve normal NLPs as well as optimization problems, and test them using this framework.\r\n\r\nModelTestingFramework is another idea and gently increases the odds that it's not statistical model testing, but still probably too ambiguous. ModelUnitTesting perhaps? I don't have _great_ support for writing unit tests as that name would imply, but it's a good direction for the library to grow in and isn't _wrong_ now.\r\n\r\nI'm going to ask Chris/Yingbo to see if they're okay with ModelingToolkitTesting because I think that's the best name so far.",
