      "body": "I'm assuming this package is for use in the MTH299 course at an institution. If so, I don't think it is a good fit for the general registry. The general registry is a shared resource for the whole Julia community, so it isn't great for the name MTH299Lite to refer to a specific institution's MTH299 course (e.g. why that institution and not a different institution's MTH299 course?)\r\n\r\nI think it would be fine to register this package under the name CollegeOfStatenIslandMTH229Lite, though under the current General registry guidelines even that would not be allowed\r\n\r\n> The General registry is not a place for \"personal packages\" that consist of collections of \"utility functions\" nor for packages that are only useful for a closed group (like a research group or a company). For that, it is easy to set up your own registry using for example LocalRegistry.jl. The Pkg documentation about registries might be useful if you decide to go this route.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General#should-i-register-my-package-now",
