      "body": "The main difference between this `MUMPS3` and the other two MUMPS packages is 1) the API, and 2) a more full-featured interface with the MUMPS sparse direct solver.\r\n\r\nIt appears that [https://github.com/JuliaSparse/MUMPS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSparse/MUMPS.jl) interfaces with MUMPS 5.0.1 which is several versions out of date (current is 5.2.0), and furthermore it's not clear to me that it is being actively maintained. I'm not sure how many of the MUMPS features it accessed, as the documentation doesn't describe it.\r\n\r\nAs for the other,  [https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/MUMPS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/MUMPS.jl), that is actively maintained and up to date but uses a very different API, and does not currently use some of the features of MUMPS. `MUMPS3` (proposed package) relies on the same Homebrew recipe to build the MUMPS dynamic libraries as the JuliaSmoothOptimizers/MUMPS package.\r\n\r\nI built this package to use the Schur-complement methods of MUMPS, which were not, and are not yet at the time of writing, part of JuliaSmoothOptimizers/MUMPS.  It was not clear to me how to extend either JuliaSmoothOptimizers/MUMPS or JuliaSparse/MUMPS for my own purposes, so I tried something new. Even though I was only trying to get the Schur capabilities, the structure of the new API made it possible to access all of the MUMPS features essentially in one go, which I thought made it worth publishing.\r\n\r\nAs for the name, you are correct in noting that there is no `MUMPS2`. There are, however, the two packages you listed with the same name, which suggested the \"3\". I am not happy with the name `MUMPS3`, and am open to any suggestions or changes.",
