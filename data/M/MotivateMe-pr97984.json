I think the word \"Quotes\" is much more closely tied to the package's functionality than the word \"Me\". Plus, I think the scope and purpose of the package are immediately clear from the name \"MotivationalQuotes\" while they are not as clear for \"MotivateMe\" (my initial guess based on the name MotivateMe, before reading the docs was that it had some sort of more technical approach to motivation).\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
