Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 2 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to CEnum. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  2. Similar to EnumX. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Automerge is blocked because `MEnums` is too close in Levenshtein distance to other names. The example given for why this rule exists is\r\n> `Websocket` is too close to `WebSockets` and can be confusing to users.\r\n\r\nThe example is reasonable. In fact it's a great example. It would be very easy to confuse these names without realizing it. But this is not the case with `MEnums`, `Enums` and `EnumsX`. The psychology of mistyping and failing to recognize is very different in the latter case. Perhaps the author of the registered package `EnumsX` pointed this out when registering it. (By the way,automerge is also blocked on another package I am trying to register: `BitsX`. The name is too close to `Bits`.)\r\n\r\nOriginally, I chose `MEnums` for mutable enums. I really don't like `MutableEnums`. Furthermore it's no longer the only or main distinguishing feature. Furthermore, \"mutable\" is not the right word. You can add instances after the new enum type is created, which is not really mutation.\r\n\r\nHow about `EnumsPlus`? My personal opinion is that's a terrible name. But, if it allows the package to be registered, so be it. It also could be confused with `EnumsX`, because they both clearly mean \"enums with more features\". But you could easily forget the difference and have to look up which enhanced package you wanted. `EnumsPlus` is probably easier to confuse with `EnumsX` than `MEnums`, but the Levenshein algorithm can't know this.\r\n",
