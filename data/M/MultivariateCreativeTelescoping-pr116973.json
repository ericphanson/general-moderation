      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "[noblock] I would recommend putting the introductory paragraph from your documentation also into your README. It's always good to give people an idea of what the package does without having to click through to the documentation.\r\n\r\nAlso: Are you sure you want to tag this as `v1.0`? That would be contradictory to the statement in your README \"This package is still in development\". A package tagged at `v1.0` should have a stable API that is fully documented, a test suite with reasonably good coverage (on the order of 80%, maybe), and it should be relatively complete, with respect to the scope that it defines for itself. Releasing an \"early version\" would typically be `v0.1`. Note that you can always switch from any `v0.x` version to `v1.0` as soon as the package is stable. Tagging `v1.0` is not a \"breaking change\".",
