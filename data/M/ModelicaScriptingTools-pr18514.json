You may find [CompatHelper](https://github.com/bcbi/CompatHelper.jl) helpful for keeping your compat entries up-to-date.Note: If your package works for the current version `x.y.z` of a dependency `foo`, then a compat entry `foo = x.y.z` implies a compatibility upper bound for packages following semver. You can additionally include earlier versions your package is compatible with. See https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/compatibility/ for details.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

It contains the following changes from the last non-package version:\r\n> \r\n> ### Added\r\n> \r\n> * function `withOMC` that allows to setup a `OMCSession` that can be used with `do`\r\n> * unit tests for individual functions\r\n> * support for regression tests with `outputFormat=\"mat\"`\r\n> * documentation using Documenter.jl\r\n> * Travis CI script\r\n> \r\n> ### Changed\r\n> \r\n> * project structure changed to standard Julia package structure\r\n> * module name is now `ModelicaScriptingTools` instead of `MoST`\r\n> * `getVariableFilter` and `getSimulationSettings` now throw `MoSTError`s if the requested model does not exist\r\n> * use `__MoST_experiment` instead of `__ChrisS_testing` as vendor specific annotation\r\n> * `refDir` parameter in `testmodel` and `regressionTest` now is relative to CWD instead of output dir\r\n> * result of `getSimulationSettings` and parameter `settings` in `simulate` now contains unescaped values`\r\n> \r\n> ### Fixed\r\n> \r\n> * only use `ZMQ.send` without `ZMQ.recv` for sending `quit()` to avoid freezing\n<!-- END RELEASE NOTES -->\n\n<!-- bf0c69308befbd3ccf2cc956ac8a46712550b79fc9bfb5e4edf8f833f05f4c18b06eddad8845b45beb9f45c2b8020dd63580155ccd478c162a32134a97a1e3e178cfafee1e38ced5ba34830b7f53718432f3ae9c33584f53eeec3d1847e2b1ef95966ec9def01b89746d5c87fb4fc6c43410a4023d97367e36ff71450eca452ca4a1428697837578d044bdd61b41c0ddabadf5eb5d48b12d1a414c8a5c35b0fe116f464fc485075d31aa307ac818e9871819be8f9b0340eecfaf214106c8b3494db456eca8efef9385a218fb021ea89cb6c6cfdaae3da60602de0346b1c916c0087517628120c5c96ff980bb0ad72f84 -->",
