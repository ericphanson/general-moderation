      "body": "Hi @Moelf &mdash; Originally I had intended to submit this functionality as PR to StatsBase, but based on [advice of others there](https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsBase.jl/pull/760) it seemed better to try to find a home for it as a standalone utility or in a different package. I thought it would be a good learning experience to make my own package for the first time so opted to try going that route, which is why I've done this. This is a really common utility used by a lot of people in academia (I'm an astrophysics PhD student), and things like this that are missing from Julia are a big barrier to entry for some of my colleagues. You are correct that some of this functionality is already possible with existing packages, but this way is much faster (>10x speed-up compared to using the StatsBase histogram method, for example). This is detailed more in my original linked PR if you would like to read more there. I had hoped I could continue adding commonly used routines that exist in other languages (Python, IDL, etc.) but that do not yet exist in Julia to this new package as I think that would be a useful tool for myself + others in my field, but if you think that's not worth having as a package I suppose I can distribute ad-hoc internally.

If you think this could be integrated into FHist.jl @Moelf let me know and happy to go that route as well!",
