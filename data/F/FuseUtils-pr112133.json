How many FuseX.jl do you plan to register?\n\nAlso note that it's generally better to release the main package as soon as possible when registering ecosystem packages.

Like say Oceananigans.jl is not called MITOceananigans.jl.\r\n\r\nI wasn't suggesting a rename FUSE.jl -> GAFUSE.jl but was talking about its dependencies, specifically those that are named FuseXYZ.jl. I'm fine with FUSE.jl. It seems to be a cool, serious effort, you are the first to occupy the name, and I understand that it's an adequate, catchy name for a bigger project. The fact that FUSE is ambiguous is unfortunate but acceptable, IMO. What I was wondering is whether we can find a better naming compromise for dependencies like FuseUtils.jl, which could also be confused with FUSE (the file system / kernel module) utilities.\r\n\r\nLooking at the FUSE.jl repo, it seems like FuseUtils.jl is the only \"problematic\" dependency. Would it be possible to rename FuseUtils.jl to something less generic and less ambiguous?\r\n\r\n(UPDATE: I see that there also is [FuseExchangeProtocol.jl](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/tree/master/F/FuseExchangeProtocol) in General...)\r\n\r\n> Unfortunately I don't see a way to register the main package as soon as possible if I cannot register its dependencies first.

      "body": "[noblock] Just my opinion: I think we should give `FUSE.jl` in particular a pass, given how fully developed it is. And Julia is a language for scientific computing, so having a particularly nice fusion-related package called `FUSE` seems okay, even if it's not about the possibly more widely understood \"Filesystem in Userspace\".\r\n\r\nWhile FUSE.jl can't be registered without its dependencies being registered first, that package will require a manual merge anyway (uppercase name rule), so I don't think we'll run into a situation where someone else will register `FUSE.jl` without anyone noticing. Another option would be to prepare a manual PR to register the entire FUSE ecosystem in one go (FUSE.jl and all its currently unregistered dependencies).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for \"sub-packages\" like `FuseUtils`: My general opinion is that an existing `MyPackage` \"owns\" the namespace for `MyPackageSomething` packages. In this case, that would be `FUSEUtils` (with an uppercase `FUSE`, and I'm not a fan of deviating from CamelCase by making the `U` in `Utils` lower-case). Using `FuseUtils` already deviates from this (case-sensitive) scheme, where the package name is \"obviously\" connected to `FUSE.jl`. So at that point it might be better to go with `FusionUtils`. But I'm not super opposed to `FuseUtils` either. However, since `Fuse/FUSE` is such an overloaded name, I don't think it would be fair for `FUSE.jl` to completely own the `FuseSomething` namespace. It'll have to co-exist with other packages related, e.g., to the filesystem FUSE. It's not an ideal situation, but probably tolerable.",
