Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to FMM2D. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1. Normalized visual distance 0.75 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

The difference is clear.\r\n\r\nMoreover, wrapping them in the same way risks confusion at important implementational differences: for example, the 2D library does not (yet) support Laplace. And while the interface may be similar even for `FMMLIB2D`, yet another FMM library that actually does support Laplace, the `FMM3D` and `FMMLIB2D` libraries differ significantly in how they treat evaluation at source-points (targets having a nontrivial intersection with sources). Thus, in the end the user is going to need to pay heed to the documentation for the relevant library, anyway.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as the above differences show there are plenty of different FMM implementations. One can imagine kernel-independent FMMs as well sharing such a common interface. Must all these be wrapped in a single library simply because their names are somewhat similar, yet clearly and understandably distinct?",

As one of the maintainers of the `FMM3D` package, personally I would prefer to keep the current name `FMM3D` agreeing with our friends @mipals @maltezfaria . We (the main authors https://fmm3d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ackn.html) also discussed in our internal group meeting today, we do prefer to keep the current name if it is possible. We appreciate your help.",
