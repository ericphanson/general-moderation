If that's the case, there is no need for this PR (FortranNamelistParser.jl).\r\n\r\nIf https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/117210 does not support our project repos, we would like to get this PR merged so that we can register other packages that rely on this functionality.\r\n\r\nThe situation is this: \r\n\r\n* @singularitti started the project https://github.com/singularitti/Fortran90Namelists.jl\r\n* We have been working on our packages in private repos earlier and we needed the base functionality of https://github.com/singularitti/Fortran90Namelists.jl and 2 additional functions, so this repo was forked in our org and we added the two functions.\r\n* Meanwhile, @singularitti updated their repo bit more and made it better.\r\n\r\nNow, we wanted to publish our packages and register with Julia but @singularitti wants to work more on their package before registering it with Julia (probably because they have a much larger application scope in mind). So with permission form @singularitti we are publishing a fork of his latest repo with the additional two functions.\r\n\r\nI added the strange statement in README because I did not want anyone to misconstrue this as me stealing @singularitti's contribution. @singularitti is the major contributor of all the code in the package. But since it is under MIT license, we wanted to register it ourselves so that we can register our other packages.\r\n\r\nSo, I'll definitely put this relationship between packages in README and docs soon. I'll also see if https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/117210 is good enough for our purposes, in which case, we'll abandon this package.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

I’ve been pretty busy lately and wasn’t aware that there’s a new package [`FortranNamelists.jl`](https://gitlab.com/seamsay/FortranNamelists.jl). After a quick review, it seems that `FortranNamelists.jl` is quite different from my design and has its own merits. @anchal-physics, could you test whether it meets your needs? If so, we could potentially collaborate to make this package the state-of-the-art Fortran namelist parser.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

It emulates reading and writing of namelist as is done in Fortran, while we simply want to parse Fortran namelists written or read by other Fortran based softwares and use the information, ideally as a dictionary. So I don't think it meets our needs.\r\n\r\nAgain, I would emphasize that I simply want a working dependency registered here as soon as possible so that we can release our other packages. We'll be more than happy to change dependency to a better working and up to date solution when it comes up in the registry next.\r\n\r\nHowever, @goerz if this seems unreasonable from the community point of view, which I understand, then I'll try to trim our packages so that we don't use FortranNamelistParser anymore which reduce our functionality only slightly but we would definitely require it in future to expand further as we are reading Fortran based simulation outputs. Let me know what you think is the best solution here.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

      "body": "Maybe there's room for two packages, `FortranNamelist` as a reader and writer, and `FortranNamelistParser` here as a second approach. But IMO, I don't think there's then also room for `Fortran90Namelists` as a fork/variant for `FortranNamelistParser`. If we're merging `FortranNameListParser` now, I would be fairly opposed to having a registration of `Fortran90Namelists` at some later point in time. Instead, @singularitti would have to contribute any further development to the `FortranNameListParser` repository – which would probably be best anyway. Why do you want to keep two separate forks of the same project under active development? I can't imagine that the plans for the two forks are so divergent that these future developments would be incompatible.\r\n\r\nI don't know. Maybe I'll have to solicit some opinions on this. If there's some consensus in the community that having all three of these packages registered is fine, I certainly won't stand in the way.\r\n\r\nIf this registration of `FortranNamelistParser` is only there as a dependency for the packages in a specific org, it might also be possible to just have the code in some `Base`/`Core` package of that org. Something that's a dependency of all the other packages, without specifically being about Fortran namelist parsing. Or, use a package name that makes it really clear that this package is specific to the context of a specific org, like `TorreyPinesFortranNamelistParser`. For a pure dependency that's not user-facing, a super long package name like that isn't really a problem, and it would make it clear to people that this package isn't intended for public use.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

Then, we can just move ahead with the registration of `FortranNamelists and `FortranNamelists` would be the \"go to\" package for Fortran namelists in Julia.
