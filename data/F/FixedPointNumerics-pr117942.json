      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

It's better to update an existing registration PR rather than starting a new PR.\r\n\r\nAlso, generally speaking, \"Largely undocumented […] alpha quality at the moment\" is usually [not something you should submit for registration yet](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General?tab=readme-ov-file#should-i-register-my-package-now). Typically, `v0.1` (rather than `v0.0.1`), a.k.a. \"beta quality\" is the recommended initial version for registration. This particular package looks just about (barely) developed and documented enough that it _could_ pass as `v0.1`. Thus, I'd be okay with letting the registration continue.",
