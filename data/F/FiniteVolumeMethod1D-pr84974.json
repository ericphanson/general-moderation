      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to FiniteVolumeMethod. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "I think it should be fine to have this and also FiniteVolumeMethod.jl. They're both for similar problems, but this is for 1D rather than 2D problems and requires very little dependencies compared to my 2D version, so I'd prefer to not have to combine the two packages and have separate names. Wouldn't be too confusing for users either anyway I'm pretty sure? \r\n\r\n[noblock]",

      "body": "Since you also own the encroached package `FiniteVolumeMethod.jl`, and the 1D addition to the name serves the purpose of indicating a clear difference in purpose, this name similarity seems fine to me (a Julia community member, but not a moderator).\r\n\r\n~~Non-blocking, and possibly naive on my part, question for the author: would it ever make sense to merge/consolidate this functionality into the prior package? On the surface it seems like a lower-dimensional case of the same kind of problem, and I would imagine the user bases for both have a large overlap.~~ (Disregard, just re-read your post.)\r\n\r\n[noblock]\r\n",
