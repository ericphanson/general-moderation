      "body": "Hi @gdalle, the objective if not quite the same (correct me if I'm wrong): FiniteDifferences.jl approximates derivatives of functions, whereas the ultimate objective of FiniteDifferenceMethods.jl is to apply it to discrete fields on Cartesian grids: classical formulas for Laplacian, forward/backward differentiation...\r\n\r\nThe motivation is to gather code that I regularly need (instead of copy-pasting), and made it easily available to students/collaborators. If you think it's too confusing, I can make a local registry somewhere else, just let me know. Thanks!",

      "body": "I think the name could be okay in principle, but it’s very general, and thus the package should live up to slightly higher standards of being “authoritative”. It should also have a commitment to long-term maintenance, which would include being hosted under an organization with multiple owners.\r\n\r\nI would expect the package to be a little bit more mature before registration, with full documentation. So maybe keep it in a LocalRegistry for now, and resubmit it to General when it’s somewhat more “stable”?",
