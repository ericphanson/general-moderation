      "body": "> some thoughts:\r\n\r\nThank you for your response! There is a rather fundamental misunderstandings here, and I'm quite sure you're not the only one that has this misunderstanding. So let me try to respond in a bit more detail\r\n\r\n> I don't recall \"Package largely empty\" being a failing criterion for package registration _before_. This is the first time I see it.\r\n\r\nThe [guidelines for `General`](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/?tab=readme-ov-file#faq) have been in place for a long time, long before I ever got involved with Julia. We've never allowed empty placeholder packages. Maybe, until a few years ago there was also very little enforcement or review of registrations. So some things may have slipped through, [but that is no argument for _new_ registrations](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/?tab=readme-ov-file#my-new-package-registration-pr-fails-one-or-more-automerge-checks-because-of-reason-x-however-the-general-registry-already-contains-a-package-pastpackage-that-does-thing-x-will-registry-maintainers-consider-this-pastpackage-when-they-evaluate-my-new-package-registration-pr).\r\n\r\n> I wasn't able to properly develop since attempts to `precompile()`ing dependent packages issues the complaint that the dependency is not registered 🙄 (:roll_eyes)!!\r\n\r\nYes, and this is the crucial point: \"Registered\" does not mean \"Registered in the `General` registry\". It's absolutely true the developing interdependent package is nearly impossible without registering them. But \"registration\" means a [LocalRegistry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl). In contrast, the `General` registry is for sharing packages with the larger community. These packages must be \"ready\" and contain useful functionality and enough documentation that others can figure out how to use them. Until they reach that stage, they should be \"registered\", but not in the `General` registry.\r\n\r\nNot to get too far off track, but there is even a sizable group of maintainers that want to push for registration [meeting the much higher standard of a 1.0 release](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/issues/111019), which would include a stable and fully documented API. I'm not particularly in favor of that proposal, exactly for the reason that your response shows: In many people's mind, registration in `General` is almost a prerequisite, and we need to have much better communication about the development lifecycle of projects before they are mature enough to belong in `General`.\r\n\r\nUsing a `LocalRegistry`, or working with unregistered packages (e.g., via [the new `[sources]` feature](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/toml-files/#The-%5Bsources%5D-section)) should be the norm.\r\n\r\n> The very fact that `precompile()` complains about unregistered dependencies, _should instruct registration gate-keepers to be more aware of it, and considerate of one's choice for package development paradigm_, in this and many other cases, of having a small, fundamental/**Base** package with **common anchors** (TypeSystem), **imports**, **definintions**, is a **package development paradigm** quite in use in the julia ecossytem.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with that paradigm! It's extremely common and useful, but that doesn't mean that development _starts_ with a registration in `General`.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I was inspired towards this package development paradigm by no less than the eminent `DifferentialEquations` ecosystem, that quite regularly includes quite (seemingly) \"empty\" packages like this one: [DiffEqPDEBase](https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqPDEBase.jl/blob/master/src/DiffEqPDEBase.jl) — see? another \"Base\" package that seems empty/useless/niche at first, but belonging to a greater ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThat particular package is 8 years old and marked as obsolete. And besides that, as I said before: I _do_ apply lower standards to a `Base` package, as it is not user-facing. Basically, I think a registration of a `Base` package would (or should) be treated in relation to the ecosystem that it is part of. If that ecosystem is still \"empty\", it is not yet time for the `Base` package to be registered in `General`.\r\n\r\n\r\n> If small players like me are to be given a hard time having pre-requisite, fundamental, Base packages registered\r\n\r\nThat is not what is happening here! First, there is no fundamental distinction between \"big\" and \"small\" players (yes: big established organization would have an easier time with registering a very general package name like `DifferentialEquations` because they can guarantee continuing maintenance; but that's an entirely different issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n> thus hindering one's preferred flow, since other packages down the road cannot (pre)compile due to unregistered dependencies, we'll be forced to change the development paradigm\r\n\r\nYou are not being asked to change your development workflow\r\n\r\n> which is very unfortunate / counter productive and annoying and discriminatory, since the registry already have plenty of \"largely empty\" packages already registered and in production\r\n\r\nEven accounting for `Base` package, I don't actually think that there are many \"largely empty\" packages. Certainly, they would all receive the same scrutiny if registered today.\r\n\r\n> not to mention the unjustified ban or downplay of a package development paradigm, used by some, cannot be used by others.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely not! The paradigm of `Base` packages is open to _all_ developers. The misunderstanding is that that paradigm relies on registrations in the `General` registry.\r\n\r\n\r\n> As for the \"personal\" package wording, I believe to be quite common among brand new packages developers who first have a particular problem to tackle in mind, and don't want to include elegance everywhere (or at all) until the problem is solved, the working concept is tested and established, and then a more formal, better though, form is produced, before removing the \"personal\" label.\r\n\r\nLet's not get too hung up on the \"personal\" wording. What I was trying to say is that a `Base` package _by itself_ is not really useful to the larger Julia community. That makes it not a good candidate for registration in `General` before there isn't at least one other package that relies on it. I'm not saying `Base` packages shouldn't be registered in `General`! This is only about _when_ they should be registered.\r\n\r\n> Finally, I'm _**NOT** asking for this particular package to be registered_, as I already steered to another direction.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason for you to change your development workflow, in terms of having a `Base` package. The only thing you have to do is to make [LocalRegistry](https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl) part of your workflow.\r\n\r\n> I just leave this thoughts here to prompt reflection.\r\n\r\nYes, thank you! To me, that reflection should be on how and where to better communicate the role that the `General` registry plays in the ecosystem, and what the right time is for a package to be registered in `General`.\r\n\r\n",
