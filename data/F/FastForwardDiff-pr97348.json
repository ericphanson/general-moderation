FWIW there are open issues at ForwardDiff for these features @ https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl/issues/328 & https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl/issues/610 where some of this stuff has been discussed.\r\n\r\nIs the package still acceptable for registration under these circumstances?\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

      "body": "[noblock] Hi there,\r\ngreat that you are registering a package! I feel that your first argument of using ForwardDiff internals is even an argument more for _including_ your part into ForwardDiff, since now you might just have broken code with a patch release of forward diff, since they would probably consider their internals something nonbreaking to change.\r\n\r\nConcerning the second part – you could maybe ask for help concerning the weak dependency and maybe first ask whether it _is_ a dealbreaker for them?\r\nI personally would prefer if you try that first – as well as if this would be within ForwardDiff – but I am not involved in that package _and_ @gdalles comment is already blocking, so I trust his final decision to unblock – hence this is nonblocking :)",

I thought of other alternatives for stripping units generically such as doing `x/oneunit(x)`, but these are also suboptimal.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: I ended up finding a way to add Unitful support as a plain extension.",
