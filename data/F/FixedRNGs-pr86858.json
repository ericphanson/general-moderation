Judging by the name I was expecting some Quasi Monte-Carlo scheme, but looking at the code it's just a fixed number every time, so I was a bit surprised :rofl: \r\nCan I suggest a renaming to `FixedNumberGenerators`? The `R` really doesn't belong here IMHO",

      "body": "[noblock]\r\n\r\nThanks @gdalle . I agree the name can be improved, but I think the name should either indicate that it's `<:AbstractRNG`, or something about the main use case.  `FixedNumberGenerators` doens't meet either of these IMO. How about either\r\n- `TrivialRNGs` or `ConstantRNGs`, or\r\n- `TestValues`. Our main use case is the `testvalue` function, providing an arbitrary point in the support of a measure. The name is taken from PyMC, so it's maybe a little more familiar. In this case we'd bring the `testvalue` function here (currently it's in MeasureBase).\r\n\r\n@oschulz any thoughts on this?",
