Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- The following dependencies do not have a `[compat]` entry that is upper-bounded and only includes a finite number of breaking releases: CSV\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

My intention is that `KendallTau.corkendall` does get moved to `StatsBase`, and there is an [open issue](https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsBase.jl/issues/849) for that. It has not been \"turned down\" by the maintainers of `StatsBase`, who were very helpful when I was fine tuning my previous contribution to `StatsBase`, which was in fact the current version of `StatsBase.corkendall`. What I hope will happen is that `KendallTau.corkendall` moves to `StatsBase`, and `KendallTau` then exists to export other functions which would not sensibly live in `StatsBase`, of which there is currently only one: `corkendall_fromfile`.",

      "body": "To quote the first sentence of the relevant Wikipedia article:\r\n\"In statistics, the Kendall rank correlation coefficient, commonly referred to as Kendall's τ coefficient (after the Greek letter τ, tau)\" It's on that basis that I went for KendallTau as a package name.\r\n\r\nThe package has additional functionality that does not sit well in StatsBase, namely calculation of tau direct from a CSV file, and calculation of tau using the slow \"naive\" algorithm, rather than Knight's algorithm. The latter was helpful in writing more thorough tests of an implementation than would typically be included in automated tests. In my earlier work to speed up the single-threaded implementation of `corkendall` comparison against the naive algorithm revealed the possibility of overflow errors in the code as was, so I think there is value in the naive implementation.\r\n\r\nFor me, a consideration is that getting additional functionality into a package such as StatsBase, upon which a great many packages depend, is a slow process. I would benefit from being able to release functionality to a more agile, but still registered package. Where appropriate, I can then raise PRs to transfer the functionality to a more widely-used package such as StatsBase.",
