Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 4 existing packages.\n  1. Similar to TSVD. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1.\n  2. Similar to PSID. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  3. Similar to CSV. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n  4. Similar to SVR. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) to ask for help. Include a link to this pull request.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. You can edit blocking comments, adding `[noblock]` to them in order to unblock auto-merging.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "[noblock]\r\n\r\n## Justification for the naming.\r\nThe KSVD algorithm is a relatively well known algorithm, e.g. [with it's own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-SVD). Although certainly not known to all Julia users, I believe that to people familiar with the SVD algorithm, the naming KSVD should be clear.\r\n\r\nThere are also similarly named packages like [`TSVD.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/TSVD.jl).\r\nIn fact, for TSVD one could reason to instead name it `TruncatedSVD`. However, our this case, `KSVD` literally stands for `k-SVD`, i.e. the `k` is not short for anything.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can still also consider names like these:\r\n- `KSVDIteration` (however imo not `IterativeKSVD`, as that implies there's a closed-form KSVD)\r\n- `KSVDAlgorithm` (I think the `Algorithm` would be redundant.)\r\n- `DictionaryLearningKSVD` (this would perhaps make sense if there was also `DictionaryLearningBase`, etc, but currently there is not and also I don't think anybody plans to make one)\r\n- `ParallelKSVD` similar to [`ParallelKMeans`](https://github.com/PyDataBlog/ParallelKMeans.jl). However, KSVD.jl implementation provides optimize **single-threaded**, multi-threaded, GPU accelerated, and (WIP) distributed acceleration. Still, I think it's a reasonable contender.\r\n- `FastKSVD`, but that reminds me of something like [`FastSLAM`](https://robots.stanford.edu/papers/montemerlo.fastslam-tr.pdf) which makes algorithmic modifications to be faster. We don't.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts.\r\nThanks!",

So should be ok.\r\n> \r\n> It is a bit unfortunate, in that it is not an implementation of the SVD, but uses the SVD to implement clustering algorithms. So KSVDClustering or something might be a better name - and perhaps it is worth asking the authors to reconsider the name to see if we can do something better. If not, then I would go ahead and accept.",
