      "body": "> once I finish writing the README file.\r\n\r\nI would generally ask that the README file is complete _before_ the registration goes through. [The general point](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/when-does-it-make-sense-to-post-a-new-package-to-the-julia-repository/108701/4), is to have a description of the package's purpose and a small usage example in (or linked from) the README. An important part of packages in General is that any potential user can figure out what the package is about and how to get started with using it. That is really difficult when there is a lack of documentation.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, I definitely recommend setting up a [Documenter](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/)-based documentation. Before a `v1.0` release, or for smaller packages that can be effectively described entirely with their `README`, that's not a requirement, though.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to make a general comment on the name: I haven't been able to find out very much about [the original KRAKEN](https://oalib-acoustics.org/website_resources/AcousticsToolbox/manual/kraken.html), specifically whether it is an acronym or not. It seems like it is not, but that the uppercase spelling is a remnant of Fortran code using uppercase formatting back in the day. If it was an acronym (and widely recognized as such), `KRAKEN.jl` in https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/127169 would have actually been appropriate. Just for future reference, the bot-rule against all uppercase letters is not a _hard_ rule. Changing a package name _just_ to make a bot happy is usually not a good idea. Alas, in this case, `Kraken` seems like the appropriate name, so let's stick to that.\r\n\r\nThat being said, a search shows the \"Kraken\" is a heavily overloaded name in software projects. At least, there's a popular [OCR project](https://kraken.re/main/index.html), a [cryptocurrency exchange](https://kraken.com), an [image optimizer](https://kraken.io) and [possibly more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_(disambiguation)). That makes me a little uneasy about monopolizing the name in `Kraken.jl`. My recommendation would probably be for `AcousticKraken.jl`. I leave this up to your best judgment, though. Ultimately, there is a bit of a \"first come, first serve\" policy. That doesn't mean it's not a good idea to disambiguate package names as much as possible, since the General registry has to serve a very wide audience.\r\n\r\nWhen you renamed from `KRAKEN` to `Kraken`, it seems like the uppercase spelling is still in a lot of places, like the README and the tests. That also means the tests aren't currently being run. I _strongly_ recommend setting up automated tests before registering the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> I think the suggestion was to go to a pre-release version 0.x.y\r\n\r\nThat's one possibility, the other being to go to 1.0 (or keep 1.2), but bringing the documentation and tests into shape, for that label to be justified.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would usually make the initial public release <1.0. You can still go from, e.g., v0.1 to v1.0 without substantive changes later on, if the original API proves to be useful. However, for a package like this, where the API is determined by the original KRAKEN project, there might be less room for the \"experimental\" pre-1.0 stage of development. An initial public version 1.0 would then be fine, provided it can live up to the expectations set by semantic versioning.\r\n\r\n> KRAKEN is just a very well known name for a program in the field of underwater acoustics, and it is referenced in dozens, if not hundreds, of papers in the field.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify this further: Different languages have different naming conventions. Especially with compiled languages like Fortran/C++, there's never been a central authority, and names tend towards \"short\" and also towards acronyms. This is very much not the case with Julia, where the community expectation is mostly for `LongDescriptiveName` (unless there's a witty short name like `Makie` or something like that). Acronyms in particular are very frowned upon. I recommend that when people switch from some other language to Julia, they adapt to Julia's conventions instead of bringing over conventions from the other language.\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions to the naming guidelines for wrappers, or potentially for translations as well. The automatic rule again all-cap names is mainly to protect against random acronyms. At least in my opinion, it should not cover _pronounceable_ acronyms. But still, it doesn't seem like the original KRAKEN is actually an acronym, so I think the more Julian variation of that name, `Kraken` (or `AcousticKraken`), is preferable and still has plenty of name recognitions to potential users familiar with the traditional KRAKEN.",
