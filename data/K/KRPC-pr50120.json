Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\n- Name is not at least 5 characters long\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to CRC. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment.

      "body": "Three issues were identified as part of the automerge pipeline:\r\n\r\n* Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\r\n* Name is not at least 5 characters long\r\n* Package name similar to 1 existing package.\r\n  *  Similar to CRC. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Characters in the name:\r\n\r\nThe automatic system identified three character-related requirements that the name fails:\r\n\r\n* starts with an upper-case letter\r\n* ASCII alphanumerics only\r\n* not all letters are upper-case.\r\n\r\nOn the former, I do not understand how capital \"K\" is not an upper-case letter. Similarly, to my knowledge (and hex editor), every character in \"KRPC\" is an ASCII alphanumeric character. The latter point will be addressed in more detail in the following section on name length, but follow from this library being a wrapper over the kRPC remote procedure call library and following naming guideline #6.\r\n\r\n## Name length \r\n\r\nThe former is due to following guideline #6 in the naming recommendations, to whit,\r\n\r\n> Packages that wrap external libraries or programs should be named after those libraries or programs.\r\n\r\nThis package wraps the [kRPC](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/index.html) remote procedure call interface, and, as such,\r\nis named after it. To meet the requirement that packages must start with an upper-case letter, the package is named \r\nKRPC and not kRPC. \r\n\r\n## Package name similarity\r\n\r\nThe similarity arises due to the very short name, again arising from being named after the RPC system it is wrapping.  In my opinion, the names are to a human clearly distinct and the functionality wildly divergent to the point that I think that confusion is unlikely. \r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above, I would like to request that this package addition be manually merged. The name follows directly from the software being wrapped, thus justifying the short length, and the naming \"similarity\" is a simple consequence of the short length while being highly unlikely to cause confusion in practice.",

Yes, this supersedes the earlier one, thanks.\r\n\r\n> It'd be good for your package to actually have tests, instead of an [empty set](https://github.com/BenChung/KRPC.jl/blob/305096e50cf8946cdad1a260b0e94ecde320b40a/test/runtests.jl)\r\n\r\nI'd love to! The problem is that I'm not sure what I *can* test (at least for integration testing) in this without a kRPC server to connect with, and spinning up an instance of Kerbal Space Program in CI is not particularly trivial. The main endpoints to test would be the communication routines, but mocking up the KRPC server for testing is just as likely to be buggy as the client is in the first place. I'll try and come up with some way to do it...",
