      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Thank you for submitting your package! Could you add a little bit more documentation before registering? [At the very least](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/when-does-it-make-sense-to-post-a-new-package-to-the-julia-repository/108701/4), that would be a description of the package's purpose and a small usage example in the README (or something that references the `example` folder more explicitly. An important part of packages in General is that any potential user can figure out what the package is about and how to get started with using it. That is really difficult when there is no documentation.\r\n\r\nIn the longer term, I definitely recommend setting up a [Documenter](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/)-based documentation. Before a `v1.0` release, or for smaller packages that can be effectively described entirely with their `README`, that's not so much of a requirement. But here, you are registering with an initial version `v1.0.0`, which the package may not be quite ready for.\r\n\r\nIn the Julia ecosystem, we try to encourage the proper use of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0-rc.1.html). As a general rule, versions `<v1.0` are for initial development, when the API of the package isn't nailed down yet, the package does not have a lot of dependents, and \"backwards compatibility\" is not a major concern. For an initial registration, that's usually the situation your package is in. Thus, an initial `v0.1` is usually the way to go. The bar for registering an initial `v0.1` is not very high. Basically, just\r\n\r\n* Must have a name that is appropriate for the scope of the package\r\n* Must have some non-trivial functionality (no \"placeholder\" packages)\r\n* Must have a README that explains the purpose of the package and gives a basic usage example (or a link to documentation that is sufficient to figure out how to get started)\r\n\r\nFor a version `v1.0`, you're saying that the package already has a stable API. That has some implications for what one would expect from that package. Personally, I tend to apply the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n* Must _define_ the stable API. That generally means _complete_ documentation.\r\n* Should have tests with reasonable coverage (on the order of 80%). Otherwise, there's no way to know if the package actually implements its API correctly, and no basis for figuring out whether a pull request is \"breaking\" or not, going forward.\r\n* Should somewhat reasonably fill the described scope of the package. No _major_ gaps in functionality.\r\n\r\nEven if you think your package is fairly polished already, I always recommend registering with an initial `v0.1` anyway. That way, you have a chance to find out whether there are any major flaws in the package once people start to use it. Once it has a few dependents and you really should start to worry about maintaining backwards compatibility, you can always make a `v1.0` release. That doesn't mean you absolutely have to make significant changes to the `v0.1` version. Just make sure that your package is fully documented as \"stable\" at that point, has good test coverage, and all the other things people would expect from a \"stable\" package.\r\n\r\nOf course, ultimately what versioning scheme you want to use or how to treat semantic versioning correctly is up to you.\r\n",
