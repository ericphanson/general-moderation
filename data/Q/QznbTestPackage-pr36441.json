      "body": "Hi. Your question prompted me to doubt my method but this was an initial investigation into Julia packaging with PkgTemplates.\r\n\r\nThe process is straight-forward referencing posts like <https://jaantollander.com/post/how-to-create-software-packages-with-julia-language/> and I decided to push to completion and try out TagBot (which implied registration to me). In retrospect I think a better approach would have been to either flesh out a minimally viable package or publish to a different registry, similar to how [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) is used.\r\n\r\nThat it met the guidelines for auto-merging is sufficient to declare a successful test :+1:. I have no actual need to register this test package. Please feel free to close/reject. Thanks, Mike\r\n",
