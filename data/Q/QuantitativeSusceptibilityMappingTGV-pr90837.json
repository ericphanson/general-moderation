      "body": "[noblock]\r\n\r\n@korbinian90 I unblock here, on my account, since this PR seems harmless after all (and if I'm wrong then ok since I wasn't the only one blocking). @goerz blocked also by responding, so I guess you will have to do similar.\r\n\r\nI mainly blocked in the first place to get your attention, e.g. in case you wanted to (only) use the already registered name.\r\n\r\nI unblock here, since this is an older PR and thus would go through earlier, in 1 day. It might be best to get a manual intervention still, to drop the other ASAP. This PR doesn't drop any files so it seems like a change to have both package names registered concurrently. There's strictly nothing hugely wrong with that. The registry wouldn't know if these are similar names to completely different packages, or as here linking to same repo (or I doubt that would be considered).\r\n\r\nI think if this goes thought then the latest PR would also go through and drop the other name. I see these are strictly not identical, e.g. in the dropped file:\r\n\r\ngit-tree-sha1 = \"31b91ef876942bd473e6000e4b313117861e38ca\"\r\n\r\nbut different in the replacement. I'm not up to speed on this, if right or wrong to change or doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nHypothetically, and I've considered bringing it up officially, instead of renaming, then just adding new official names, and keep the older registered name, maybe with some special marking so it's known it's a synonym. You don't think you have users already, but you wouldn't, maybe couldn't know... It seems harmless if Pkg could install synonyms, for typos even.\r\n\r\nIt would be best if it would show, e.g. you installed a synonym QuantitativeSusceptibilityMappingTgv, for QuantitativeSusceptibilityMappingTGV and using or import only works for the latter. What do you think of such? I at least we would actively not want using and import respecting both, and without a notification it could be very confusing to install a package and not be able to do using for the copy-pasted name...\r\n",
