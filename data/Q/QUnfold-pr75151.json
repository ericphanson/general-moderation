      "body": "Your `new package` pull request does not meet the guidelines for auto-merging. Please make sure that you have read the [General registry README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) and the [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). The following guidelines were not met:\n\n- Package name similar to 1 existing package.\n  1. Similar to Unfold. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 is at or below cutoff of 2. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 1 between lowercased names is at or below cutoff of 1.\n\nNote that the guidelines are only required for the pull request to be merged automatically. However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "[noblock] Dear reviewers,\r\n\r\nthe automatic merge failed because the name \"QUnfold.jl\" is similar to the existing name \"Unfold.jl\". Please merge this PR despite this similarity, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- When read or spelled to someone, \"QUnfold\" is actually easily distinguished from \"Unfold\"\r\n- Two existing scientific publications [[1](https://eldorado.tu-dortmund.de/bitstream/2003/41174/1/Dissertation.pdf), [2](https://lq-2022.github.io/proceedings/CompleteVolume.pdf)] already point to https://github.com/mirkobunse/QUnfold.jl\r\n\r\nThe name \"QUnfold\" is motivated in the fact that the package unifies algorithms from quantification / machine learning literature and unfolding literature, where the term \"unfolding\" is used in the sense known in particle physics. Apparently, the \"Unfold\" package seems to address a quite different sense of the term, which is limited to biology. Other variants of merging the terms \"quantification\" and \"unfolding\" easily lead to false suggestions, e.g. toward quantum computing.\r\n\r\nMy hope for a human merge of this PR is sparked in the following quote from the [auto-merge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/#Name-similarity-distance-check)\r\n\r\n> Note that these automerge guidelines are deliberately conservative: it is very possible for a perfectly good name to not pass the automatic checks and require manual merging. They simply exist to provide a fast path so that manual review is not required for every new package.\r\n\r\nThanks for your efforts",
