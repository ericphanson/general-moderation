However, it is **strongly recommended** to follow them, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\nAfter you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simple retrigger Registrator, which will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless of course the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number, in which case you should change the version number).\n\nIf you do not want to fix the AutoMerge issues, please post a comment explaining why you would like this pull request to be manually merged.\n\nSince you are registering a new package, please make sure that you have also read the package naming guidelines: https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1\n\n\n\n---\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

As a quantitative geneticist myself, I would urge you to either rename the package or more precisely define what your package does.

My group has three packages doing some kind of QTL mapping: FaSTLMM, LiteQTL, FlxQTL.",

      "body": "The current plan is not to include QTL mapping. Instead, since QTL is also central for genomic selection and breeding, this package was intended to include as many breeding relevant algorithms as possible. For example, population simulation, G matrix construction, its approximate inverse, matrix I/O, breeding value evaluations, and various Bayesian method. It also include some functions that are used frequently in my group. Maybe it looks ambitious, but Julia is such a powerful language and young, it is worth a try.\r\n\r\nMaybe I can add my initials to the name, like `xyQTL`. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I have been using `qtl` as my penname for nearly 20 years, such as twitter, and one of oldest Chinese website. If `QTL` is not a go still, I will try a new name.\r\n",
