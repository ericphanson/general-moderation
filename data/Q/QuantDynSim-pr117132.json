      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment. \n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "Is there any way this can just be a part of [QuantumDynamics](https://github.com/amartyabose/QuantumDynamics.jl)? Presumably, you could put it in a `QuantumDynamics.CLI` submodule.\r\n\r\n@Roger-luo Any suggestions on how to set up a package that's mainly intended as a normal Julia library, but has an _optional_ CLI component? Glancing at the documentation, it seems to me that it would be sufficient to just not write a `build.jl` file. Then, users of `QuantumDynamics` can install the CLI utilities on demand by running, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\nQuantumDynamics.CLI.comonicon_install()\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the REPL.\r\n\r\nIf, for some reason, it is not possible to keep this as part of `QuantumDynamics`, I would request `QuantumDynamicsCLI` as a package name. I would also ask to add more documentation (in the README) in this case. Give some context and a usage example, explain when and where the `qdsym` executable script is installed, probably show the output of `qdsym --help`.\r\n\r\nOf course, if it's part of `QuantumDynamics`, you'll also want to properly document the script in that package's documentation.\r\n",
