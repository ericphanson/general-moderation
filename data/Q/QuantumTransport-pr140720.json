      "body": "Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

      "body": "[noblock] Are you sure that you want to tag this initial version as `v1.0.0`? This looks like a good start for a package, but it also looks like something that could benefit from some cleanup and more in-depth documentation (at a glance, there's a lot of code in the `src` directory that does not yet have docstrings). If you intend to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), a `v1.0.0` indicates a \"stable\" API which must be formally specified and for which you make compatibility guarantees. While I strongly support getting to a stable API as early as possible, while the package isn't quite there yet, it might be better to start with version numbers `<v1.0.0` (typically, `v0.1.0`). It's up to you, though. Of course, a registered packaged should be mostly \"stable\" anyway, even if not completely polished: `Pkg` treats `v0.x.0` as \"breaking\" and General requires a changelog with specified breaking changes for any `v0.x.0` releases. So it's more about the intent that you want to communicate in relation to the semver specifications.\r\n\r\nIn any case, though, you should not create [manual tags](https://github.com/quantum-nanoelectronics/QuantumTransport.jl/tags) for your repository. Versions must be tagged _after_ they are registered, and this happens automatically via [TagBot](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/TagBot), which you already have [set up](https://github.com/quantum-nanoelectronics/QuantumTransport.jl/blob/main/.github/workflows/TagBot.yml)",
