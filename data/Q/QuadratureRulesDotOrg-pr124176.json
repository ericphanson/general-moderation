I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\n\n## 1. New package registration\n\nPlease make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\n\n## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) are all met! ✅\n\nYour new package registration met all of the guidelines for auto-merging and is scheduled to be merged when the mandatory waiting period (3 days) has elapsed.\n\n## 3. To pause or stop registration\n\nIf you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\n\n_Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\n\n<!-- [noblock] -->\n<!---\nthis_is_the_single_automerge_comment\n--->",

Wouldn't this package be perfectly fine as `QuadratureRules`?\r\n\r\nBut it unfortunately seems like there already is [QuadratureRules.jl](https://juliagni.github.io/QuadratureRules.jl/stable/). Maybe @michakraus can weight in on this? Does it make sense to have these two libraries, or would it be better to somehow combine efforts?\r\n\r\nIn any case, I would also recommend linking to or including the information in https://github.com/quadraturerules/quadraturerules/blob/main/website/pages/libraries/julia.md in the package README.",

QuadratureRules.jl is intentionally not using tabulated coefficients but instead allows to compute all coefficients of a quadrature rule to arbitrary accuracy.",
