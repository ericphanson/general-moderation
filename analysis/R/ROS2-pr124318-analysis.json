The normal workflow in Julia (which is very unusual compared to how most other systems handle it) is that you submit a particular commit for registration. Once that is merged, the [TagBot](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/TagBot) in your repo is triggered, and that is what creates the tag for the release. This is important, because you might run into problems during the registration (such as in https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/124282, but potentially also for releases after the initial registration), and you can _update_ a registration to fix these problems while keeping the version number the same. Creating the tag _after_ everything is fixed ensures that the tag is pointing to the correct commit that was actually registered.\r\n\r\nBTW, I never really understood this \"registration via comment on an issue\". I know there's an older tutorial from Chris floating around that recommends this, but personally, it makes much more sense to me to just navigate to the commit you want to submit for registration, and comment `@JuliaRegistrator register` on that commit. If something needs to be fixed, you just make another commit, or even rewrite/force-push, and just comment again on the new commit to update the existing registration PR.",
