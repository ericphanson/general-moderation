I do however think that `VCF.jl` is more appropriate.\r\n* VCF files are used a lot in bioinformatics and that's the term that people use. Fewer people would recognize Variant Call Format.\r\n* 99.9% of user who need this package already have VCF files produced by other tools. So `VCF.j` is the natural package name to search for.\r\n* Several other package names, like `CSV.jl` and `XLSX.jl` use the file extension as the package name.\r\n\r\nPreviously, VCF file IO existed in the not actively maintained package [GeneticVariation.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/GeneticVariation.jl/tree/master). It makes more sense to have it in a separate package, with fewer dependencies.\r\nSince `VCF.jl` is building on GeneticVariation.jl v0.4, I choose v0.5 as the starting version number for `VCF.jl`.",
