I am okay with this and would like to register it anyway.\r\nSome context: Air stands for **A**tomic **I**mmutables **R**esource—it's a toolbox for using persistent (immutable) data structures and [STM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory) in Julia. The data structures are functionally similar to those in the old `FunctionalCollections` repository (which I believe is no longer maintained), but they have been rewritten from the ground-up. The STM resources in Air let you compose arbitrary thread-safe atomic operations on immutable data.\r\nAir is also a nice poetic name that captures something about the feel of the library that isn't particularly quantifiable—similar to libraries like [Avalon](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/tree/master/A/Avalon) and [Fire](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/tree/master/F/Fire).\r\nThanks!",
