For this specific case, because the author insists on keeping this name, I will manually merge the registration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote to others that may find this comment in the future: A package author insisting on keeping the name does not guarantee or ensure that they will get that name. Each registration is evaluated on a case by case basis. Additionally, the standards for the General registry continue to evolve over time. Package names similar to those that were merged in the past may be rejected in the future.",
