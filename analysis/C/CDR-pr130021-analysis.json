      "text": "@goerz I don't like `CommonDataRepresentation.jl` because the name implies a generality that CDR doesn't really have. OMG CDR is common... but it's not _that_ common. In my experience, if you say \"common data representation\" you're much more likely to get question marks in response compared to \"CDR.\" As a result, I find that name rather misleading. It's like naming a `XML` package `ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.jl`.\r\n\r\nI strongly prefer the initialism because in my experience it's more widely known and used than the expansion thereof. I'd prefer to add qualifiers to the name of this package (`CDRSerialization`? Using `OMG` is probably not great since there's no actual affiliation) vs. expanding the initialism. I don't have a strong opinion about what qualifiers are used, though.",
