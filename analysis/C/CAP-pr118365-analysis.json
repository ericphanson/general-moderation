It is already part of the [GAP distribution](https://www.gap-system.org/packages/) under this three-letter name. [CAP.jl](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP.jl/) is now completely independent from GAP (and also from the registered [GAP.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/GAP.jl)). The package [CAP.jl](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP.jl/) gives native Julia access to the core package of the [CAP project](https://homalg-project.github.io/docs/CAP_project-based/), which, unlike [GAP.jl](https://github.com/oscar-system/GAP.jl), can finally run under Windows without the need of the linux subsystem. This will allow for a wider user base in computer algebra.",
