CLASS.jl is a wrapper around [CLASS](http://class-code.net/), which is a popular C code in cosmology for solving the linearized Einstein-Boltzmann equations. CLASS is short for Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System. According to [package naming convention #6](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Package-naming-rules), I have named the wrapper after the code. A manual merge is needed because CLASS only contains capital letters. 3-day wait is over now, so I am posting this on Slack.",
