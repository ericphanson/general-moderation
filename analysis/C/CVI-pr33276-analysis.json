Besides, it'd be nice to have a more descriptive name, what about `ClusterValidityIndices`? 🙂\r\n\r\nWhoopsy! About the project files, they are added to the repo and are passing unit tests. Should I create a new submission request with the populated project?\r\n\r\nAlso, about the name, I considered was worried about package name length. If the name `CVI` is a poor name and `ClusterValidityIndices` is _not_ too long, then I will be fine with changing the project name.",
