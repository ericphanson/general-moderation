I don't think it would be helpful to now add another package that breaks the pattern only by making the first letter uppercase, as `CuOpt`. That just creates unnecessary confusion. Better to say \"CUDA-related packages can use the lowercase `cu` prefix\" (also for future packages that fit the same pattern).\r\n\r\nI would not derive any kind of precedent from this that it should be okay to establish lowercase prefixes for any other (new) context. I think we should be _extremely_ strict with the first-letter-uppercase going forward. Even for wrapper packages where the wrapped library has a lowercase name. So `cu*` would be an extremely rare exception to that rule.",

I also don't think we should make a blanket statement that \"all Cuda packages from NVIDIA get lowercase `cu` at the front\", because then if someone wanted to bring the CUTLASS library into Julia we'd be having this same conversation in reverse. So I think the best thing to do is to think of this as applying rule 6 and not trying to build some pattern or general exception.\r\n\r\nSince this is the actual NVIDIA \"cuOpt\" library (even if we do build the underlying JLL instead of repackaging it, since they open-sourced this) I think that justifies having the lowercase `cu` at the start.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
