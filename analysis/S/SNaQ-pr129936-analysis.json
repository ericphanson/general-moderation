I'll try pinging some of the folks in the Julia slack\r\n\r\nThe core functions from this package package  were originally a part of [PhyloNetworks](https://github.com/JuliaPhylo/PhyloNetworks.jl) but we recently split things out to keep the scope more focused and have things a bit more modular. SNaQ is the name of the approach published [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005896) and has been known as such in the phylogenetic community, so we would like to keep the name as `SNaQ.jl`",
