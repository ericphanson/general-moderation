      "text": "I would like my pull request to be manually merged instead of via AutoMerge for ECCO.jl \r\n\r\nExplanation : the chosen name ECCO.jl stands for Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean , a major academic effort which is widely known in the climate and ocean science community by its acronym, ECCO.\r\n\r\nMore detailed explanation:\r\nECCO is a 40+ years running effort initiated by Pr. Carl Wunsch at MIT, and which now involves distributed academic projects across the US (MIT, NASA JPL, UCSD, UTA, WHOI), Europe (AWI, UH), the UK (BAS), and more.\r\nexpanding the acronym would make the package name both (1) much harder to find by the targeted scientific community, and (2) a very long package name to type. And we would much rather avoid extending to \"ECCOProject\", \"ECCOGroup\", or something like that if it's just for the sake of the >4 character naming guideline. \r\nif later on another package ended up being called ECCO.jl later, this would be damageable to our climate science and oceanography community building effort (again by making it harder for users to find the present package, and possibly turning them off from bridging to Julia, which is one of the goal of our creating this package).\r\n\r\nTimeliness : this coming week, I intend to feature this package @ https://ecco-hackweek.github.io/ecco-2024/intro.html , and would therefore greatly appreciate if merging could be expedited.\r\n",
