Additionally, it does not clash with any other package name and the only issue that seems to be present is that it is too short.\r\nIf that is indeed the case, I can change it to `Output.jl`, although I am not sure why it would be necessary.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

      "text": "Nice little package! I'm no decision maker on these things, but for what it's worth, I think the name is fine and support it.\r\n\r\nIf it's decided that this package name isn't acceptable for some reason, can I suggest the names \"Showln.jl\" and `@showln`? It's not a perfect name because the analogy between this and `@show` is not quite the same as the analogy between `print` and `println`. On the other hand, I think this is more faithful to the `show` function than `@show` itself is, so 🤷. \r\n\r\nI've had a `@showln` in my startup.jl for a long time now that basically does this, and I'd be glad to replace it with a package. \r\n[noblock]",
