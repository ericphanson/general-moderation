You might be able to get away with something like `IPFFiles`, but there really isn't any reason not to go for a maximally descriptive package name. It would still export `IPF`, so your example would just be \r\n\r\n```julia\r\nusing ESAInterpolationFiles\r\n# or (I think unqualified imports are a bad idea in general):\r\n# using ESAInterpolationFiles: IDF, compute, compute_derivative\r\n\r\n# Load an IPF file\r\nfile = IPF(\"example.ipf\")\r\n\r\n# Compute interpolated value for a given key\r\nvalue = compute(file, 10.5)\r\n\r\n# Compute derivative for a given key\r\nderivative = compute_derivative(file, 10.5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich seems perfectly nice and readable.",

The package deals with \"ESA Interpolation Files\", so the *file format* is associated with ESA, but that does not imply that your package is, or that you can't use the name of the format as part of your package.\r\n\r\n> I will go ahead and apply the required changes by the auto-merge and change the name to IPFiles.jl\r\n\r\nYeah, `IPFFiles.jl` (two `F`'s, as following the pattern `<FileExtension>Files.jl`) is probably OK, although there is also the Interchangeable Preservation Format (which ranks higher in Google), which is not ideal.",
