The package name is too close to two other packages (Intan and Ant)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we like the name `Inti`, and would like to keep it if possible. \r\n\r\nRegarding the name being \"close\" to Ant and Intan: we don't think this would cause confusion: those packages do very different things. \r\n\r\nRegarding the name being short: Inti is simultaneously similar to \"Integral equations\", which is what this package solves, and the Incan sun god. We liked the connection since many of the intended applications are related to light propagation (scattering problems). \r\n\r\nAny chance this PR can be manually merged?",
