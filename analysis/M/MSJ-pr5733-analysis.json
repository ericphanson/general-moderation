I will try to give you clearer explanations about my choice.\r\nThis package is made for mass spectrometry users not for Julia package maintainers. At the moment, its main goal is to treat tandem mass spectrometry data. For the targeted audience, tandem mass spectrometry is abbreviated as MS/MS or MS^{2}. Multistage tandem MS is referred to as MS^{n} (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_mass_spectrometry). Hence, the name of the package refers to tandem MS and to Julia with the letter J. I believe, this name might be easily remembered by the potential user's.  Other well-known packages are mzR (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mzR.html) and OpenMS (https://www.openms.de/) and both uses established acronyms in the field.\r\nThis explains why I believe anything like MassSpec of MassSpecSomehting is not a good name.\r\n ",
