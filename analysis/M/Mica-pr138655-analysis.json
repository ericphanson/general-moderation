Could you help me with this?",

      "text": "Sorry, I don't have sufficient permissions to do a manual merge.\r\n\r\nAll you can do is to bump the request every couple of days. Make sure to select \"Also send to `#pgk-registration`\" when you do. Without that, the bump would easily be missed.\r\n\r\nI think if you stick to insisting on the name, it will eventually get merged. But it can take a while. There are not that many people with permissions to merge, they tend to be busy, or not checking in on the `#pgk-registration` channel that often. And some of the maintainers also seem to be getting less comfortable with shorter names. But at least as far as the official guidelines are concerned, you should be in the clear. So I think you have a pretty good shot (hopefully)\r\n\r\n[noblock]",

For this specific case, because the author insists on keeping this name, I will manually merge the registration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote to others that may find this comment in the future: A package author insisting on keeping the name does not guarantee or ensure that they will get that name. Each registration is evaluated on a case by case basis. Additionally, the standards for the General registry continue to evolve over time. Package names similar to those that were merged in the past may be rejected in the future.",
