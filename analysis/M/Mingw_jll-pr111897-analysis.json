I guess the JLL autodetection fails when the PR comes from julia registrator instead of the Yggdrasil bot.\r\n\r\n> JLL packages are only allowed to depend on Pkg, Libdl, Artifacts, JLLWrappers, LazyArtifacts, TOML, MPIPreferences and other JLL packages\r\n\r\nThis JLL build is from BB2, which has a new `LazyJLLWrappers`.  I have a [PR open to fix this](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/RegistryCI.jl/pull/571), but it's bogged down by broken CI at the moment.  So I'm going to manually merge this so I can continue to make forward progress on BB2, which needs this registered.",
