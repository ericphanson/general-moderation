      "text": "I think \"Try\" is the best word describing the philosophy behind this package. For example, quoting the first paragraph in a discussion section [Focus on *actions*; not the types](https://github.com/tkf/Try.jl#focus-on-actions-not-the-types):\r\n\r\n> Try.jl aims at providing generic tools for composing failable procedures.  This emphasis on performing *actions* that can fail contrasts with other [similar Julia packages](https://github.com/tkf/Try.jl#similar-packages) focusing on types and is reflected in the name of the package: *Try*.  This is an important guideline on designing APIs for dynamic programming languages like Julia in which high-level code should be expressible without managing types.\r\n\r\nGiven that there are some broader interests in this type of error handling  https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/discussions/43773, I'm also willing to hand this over to a larger organization once this package is sufficiently matured and tested in the wild (e.g., to JuliaLang if `Base` needs to use something like this).\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
