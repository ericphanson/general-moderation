I updated the package name to TASOpt.jl (which might actually be a better acronym) based on the automerge bot's complaint re all caps. But we would really not want to change the repo name since we already have many forks and many more clones. Can this please be merged without the repo name change? Honestly, I would prefer just using TASOPT.jl since that's what the FORTRAN code is called. I can go back to all caps name to match the current repo name, if that's ok.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
