Since names like `JiL` are somewhat scarce, it is probably much easier to do this if the project is already pretty mature, with full documentation, and there's some community discussion about it. Maybe it would be good to make some kind of [\"pre-announcement\" on Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/package-announcements/60) to introduce the package and explain your background and motivation for developing this",

      "text": "> Those who will use it should expect the parser to change, hopefully, in a backwards-compatible way.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean though is that since you're calling `Core._setparser!(lang_parse)`, you're changing the parser used by all packages in the session non-locally, not just in the namespace or file where the user intends to use JiL (this would even affect `Base` if something got `include`ed after this package was loaded!) . That's what makes me a bit hesitant about this being in the general registry, because then it can be made a dependancy of a package and if someone loads some other random package, this could cause weird and hard to debug parsing errors even though the user might not have loaded `JiL` themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> I don't know what is expected from me at this moment. Can you tell me which of the following is needed for the package to be registered?\r\n\r\nSorry, I should have been more clear. I am also not a registry maintainer and I don't have the rights to approve or deny your package. I am just giving my feedback as to why I am a bit uncomfortable with the implementation itself so that you can consider that feedback, and so that whichever  registry maintainer ends up looking at this knows about that extra context (i.e. that this is potentially not just a naming issue). \r\n\r\nThat said, we usually don't block packages from registration just because they're doing something that a rando like me thinks is a bad idea. I just thought I'd flag it just in case it is important. \r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nSeparately, I should also say this is a really cool package and I love to see people playing around with this stuff! It's very neat, (I'm just not totally sure it is a good fit for the general registry -- but I'm also not convinced it *shouldnt* be registed)",
