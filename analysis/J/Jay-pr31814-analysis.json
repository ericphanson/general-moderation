I found this explanation:\n\nhttps://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/compatibility/\n\nbut that webpage does not explain how to come up with upper bound values.\nDo you just have to indicate some future (i.e. not yet existent) version\nnumber? So, if a dependency is at version 0.2.3 I would just use 0.3 as the\nupper bound under [compat]?\n\nThanks,\n\nMartin\n\n\n\nOp ma 15 mrt. 2021 om 13:47 schreef Eric Hanson ***@***.***>:\n\n> Reopened #31814 <https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/31814>.\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/31814#event-4458490656>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AEPAFBVXFQFTOQVVPZW3OODTDX6WNANCNFSM4ZCRKINQ>\n> .\n>\n",

So the upper bounds are actually implicit already when you use that syntax. ",
