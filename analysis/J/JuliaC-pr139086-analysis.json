That \"clarity\" rule really seems like it's becoming the main guiding principle for new registrations, by wide consensus of the registry maintainers. The package would, of course, still be providing the `juliac` command line interface.\r\n\r\nNot that I think that a package so \"core\" as this one is necessarily bound by the same considerations as other packages in the wider ecosystem.\r\n\r\n[noblock]",
