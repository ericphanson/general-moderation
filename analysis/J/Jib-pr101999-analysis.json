Not only is \"IB\" jargon, the \"J\" is also for \"Julia\", and we strongly discourage the \"Julia\" prefix/suffix for Julia packages (except for some very special cases).\r\n\r\nNote that you can write\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing InteractiveBrokers: InteractiveBrokers as Jib\r\n```\r\n\r\nin any existing code (and yes, it would be nice if in some future version of Julia that could be written as `using InteractiveBrokers as Jib`)",

If that ever becomes the problem, I think you'll have to rename, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n> that's not a convincing argument\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to try a slightly more convincing argument, it would be \"I also have `rib` for the R-version of this package, and I'd like to keep a consistent name\". But a 3-letter package name is just going to be an extremely tough sell.\r\n\r\n> Feel free to disregard this request.\r\n\r\nAlright, I'm going to close this here, but don't hesitate to try again in the future. At least with a more suitable name, this package would be more than welcome in General.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
