In my own opinion (feel free to disagree), a name that is long and general such as `GaussianBosonicSystems` or `GaussianBosons` is not likely to propagate out of the Julia ecosystem. I would like this package to reach physicists who are generally interested in simulating continuous variable quantum information. There are exceptions, of course, but most well-known quantum packages (in Julia and beyond) have simple and fun names such as `Yao.jl`, `QuTiP`, `stim`, `mitiq`, to name a few. So, if possible, I would like to stick to `Gabs`. ",
