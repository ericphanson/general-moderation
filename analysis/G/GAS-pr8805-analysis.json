So, the original name for the package was indeed `ScoreDrivenModels.jl`, but we ended up changing It because score-driven models are a somewhat broader class than just GAS. We were avoiding `GASModels` because `GasModels` already exists (https://github.com/lanl-ansi/GasModels.jl) and we want to avoid confusions. We will discuss and come up with a better alternative.",
