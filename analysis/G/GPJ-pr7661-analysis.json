That part is also important :\r\n\r\n>Package names should be sensible to most Julia users, **even to those who are not domain experts**. \r\n\r\nNote that all Julia packages indicates that they are written in Julia with the `.jl` at the end, so the equivalent of GPy would be `GP.jl` not `GPJ.jl`.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that it's easy to define a shorthand for your package when using it (e.g. `const GP = GaussianProcessModels`) so there's really no downside to having an explicit name. For example I made bindings for SDL that got renamed to `SimpleDirectMediaLayer.jl`, which I found a bit long at the time (since everybody is using the SDL acronym), but was clearly the better choice.\r\n\r\nJust my 2¢",
