Many of the other AD packages have similarly cute names, that are undescriptive (Lux / Enzyme) or minimally descriptive (Diffractor). \n\nWhen a name is *wrong*, like if Symbolics.jl was named Dictionaries.jl for some reason, I think that's a fair block. \n\nBut when a name has plenty of meanings, or it's not directly contradictory, I see no reason to reserve names like this. Enzyme for instance has little to do with enzymes for a biologist using Julia. But it's a great and recognizable name. \n\nI also would never have associated Flux, Lux, Enzyme, Umlaut, Avalon, Torch, Jax, etc with AD and ML before they existed. So I'm not sure why that should be a strict criteria. ",

      "text": "I think using existing short package names to justify new ones is a bit dubious, because many of those predecessors were registered a long time ago. Back then, I assume registration was less strict, because the space of possible names felt unlimited. But now we know it isn't, and the space of possible 3-letter packages in particular is not that big. This is especially true when accounting for edit distance constraints.\nI also don't see why there should be an exception for AD / ML packages, or packages from well-regarded developers, who would somehow get a quirkiness pass.\n\nPersonally, I think it's cool that packages have quirky and memorable names. But as a community I feel we may need to draw a line somewhere, and three letters is a good spot for it. If someome came in and wanted to register the quantum physics package Psi.jl, because Psi is the symbol of the wave function, would that be a yes too? Arguably the name has a stronger case for it. But what if the dev were unknown to the people watching the \"new packages\" feed? Regardless of package quality, would they get the same treatment?",
