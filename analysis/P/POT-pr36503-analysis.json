Since it's the name of the Python package that is wrapped here it seems reasonable to me. I don't mind renaming the package though if there is a better suggestion or standard. Overall it would just be nice to make it available since it will allow us to remove an optional PyCall-dependent submodule in OptimalTransport that caused me some trouble lately :slightly_smiling_face: ",
