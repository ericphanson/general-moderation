      "text": "> Hello, I am an automated registration bot. I help manage the registration process by checking your registration against a set of [AutoMerge guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/). If all these guidelines are met, this pull request will be merged automatically, completing your registration. It is **strongly recommended** to follow the guidelines, since otherwise the pull request needs to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.\r\n> ## 1. New package registration\r\n> \r\n> Please make sure that you have read the [package naming guidelines](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1).\r\n> ## 2. [AutoMerge Guidelines](https://juliaregistries.github.io/RegistryCI.jl/stable/guidelines/) which are not met ❌\r\n> \r\n>     * Name does not meet all of the following: starts with an upper-case letter, ASCII alphanumerics only, not all letters are upper-case.\r\n> \r\n>     * Name is not at least 5 characters long\r\n> \r\n>     * Package name similar to 18 existing packages.\r\n>       \r\n>       Similar package names\r\n>       \r\n>       1. Similar to GLM. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2. Normalized visual distance 2.21 is at or below cutoff of 2.50.\r\n>       2. Similar to BDF. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       3. Similar to BED. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       4. Similar to SVR. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       5. Similar to BERT. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       6. Similar to KLU. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       7. Similar to JLD. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       8. Similar to MLJ. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       9. Similar to LNR. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       10. Similar to BBI. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       11. Similar to Bio. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       12. Similar to BAT. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       13. Similar to BLIS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       14. Similar to GR. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       15. Similar to MLIR. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       16. Similar to CBOR. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       17. Similar to CBLS. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n>       18. Similar to TLDR. Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 is at or below cutoff of 2.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ## 3. _Needs action_: here's what to do next\r\n> \r\n>     1. Please try to update your package to conform to these guidelines. The [General registry's README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/blob/master/README.md) has an FAQ that can help figure out how to do so.\r\n> \r\n>     2. After you have fixed the AutoMerge issues, simply retrigger Registrator, the same way you did in the initial registration. This will automatically update this pull request. You do not need to change the version number in your `Project.toml` file (unless the AutoMerge issue is that you skipped a version number).\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> If you need help fixing the AutoMerge issues, or want your pull request to be manually merged instead, please post a comment explaining what you need help with or why you would like this pull request to be manually merged. Then, send a message to the `#pkg-registration` channel in the [public Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) for better visibility.\r\n> ## 4. To pause or stop registration\r\n> \r\n> If you want to prevent this pull request from being auto-merged, simply leave a comment. If you want to post a comment without blocking auto-merging, you must include the text `[noblock]` in your comment.\r\n> \r\n> _Tip: You can edit blocking comments to add `[noblock]` in order to unblock auto-merging._\r\n\r\nThis package is to enable flexible modeling of the Broad-Line Region (BLR) in astrophysics. \r\n\r\n`Broad-LineRegion.jl` is a bit lengthy so I went with `BLR.jl` although I see that is not advised in the style guide. I quite like `BLR.jl` for this package and am hoping somenoe can manually override or suggest an alternative. \r\n\r\nThanks and sorry for the inconvenience.",

      "text": "As already hinted at on Slack, there is probably very little (if any) chance to have a three-letter acronym like `BLR` accepted. Since the General registry is a shared resource the entire Julia community, even if an acronym might be commonly understood in a narrow domain of potential users of the package, it should not be used as a package name. In this case, `BLR` could mean \"Broad-Line Region\", [or it could (more likely) mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLR) \"Base Lending Rate\".\r\n\r\nMy recommendation would be to write out and probably pluralize the acronym, as `BroadLineRegions`. Unlike in other communities, long and descriptive package names are strongly encouraged in the Julia ecosystem, see the [Package naming rules](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-rules). This can take some getting used to for people coming from other languages, but once you do, you will find that it makes the ecosystem much more approachable. Fully writing out the acronym would allow you to still use the `BLR` abbreviation in your documentation and \"marketing\", up to and including recommending\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport BroadLineRegions as BLR\r\n```\r\n\r\nas a way to use your package.",
