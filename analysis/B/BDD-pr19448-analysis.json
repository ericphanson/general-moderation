My only concern was already existing users that might have their package and code break (plus `using BDD` was such a simple quaint one-liner). But on second thought, I doubt anyone is actually using my package, so why not. Better to have it on the general registry. Is there a way to have both ways? As in, leave the repo as `BDD.jl` but have it on the general registry as `BinaryDecisionDiagrams`?",

When users use your package in their code, tell them to do one of these two options:\r\n\r\nOption 1:\r\n```julia\r\nimport BinaryDecisionDiagrams as BDD\r\n```\r\n\r\nOption 2\r\n```julia\r\nusing BinaryDecisionDiagrams\r\nconst BDD = BinaryDecisionDiagrams\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way, they still get to use the `BDD` abbreviation in their code.",
