## Trends Over Time

### Overall Acceptance Trends

![Acceptance trends over time](acceptance-trends.png)

The chart above shows the number of three-letter package name registration attempts per year, split between accepted (blue) and rejected (orange) PRs. Note the dramatic shift in policy - from 50% acceptance in 2019 to near-zero acceptance in recent years.

### Accepted Packages by Category

![Accepted packages by category](acceptance-by-category.png)

This chart breaks down the accepted packages by their approval category. The dominant category is "Discretionary Approval" (packages merged without a specific exemption), which was more common in earlier years. Other categories like "Library Wrapper" and "Standard File Format" provide specific justifications for approval.

| XRT | [#114380](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/114380) | 2024-09-02 | ✅ Merged | [noblock] Being a wrapper, the name `XRT` seems okay to me, but it will need a manual merge.

| AWS | [#20506](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/20506) | 2020-08-29 | ✅ Merged | This package should be exempt to the 5 letter rule as it is a pre-existing package with a name from long before that guideline that is only now being updated to be Julia 1.0 compatible. | [JSON](../data/A/AWS-pr20506.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/A/AWS-pr20506-analysis.json) |
