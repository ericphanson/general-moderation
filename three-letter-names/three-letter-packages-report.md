|---------|------|--------|----------------|------|----------|
| FMI | #37533 | ✅ Merged | [noblock]  Dear Julia-Registrator-Team,  I read the guidelines for Julia Package Naming.  I understand, that acronyms should be avoided according to Guideline#1, but "FunctionalMockUpInterfac... | [JSON](../data/F/FMI-pr37533.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/F/FMI-pr37533-analysis.json) |

| ISL | #37152 | ✅ Merged | This is includes the Julia wrappers for the [ISL](http://isl.gforge.inria.fr/) library, and is the front-end package to ISL_jll. As such I don't think there is really a better name and I would like... | [JSON](../data/I/ISL-pr37152.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/I/ISL-pr37152-analysis.json) |

| KLU | #49410 | ✅ Merged | This name is fine since it matches the standard for wrapper packages, i.e. it's wrapping a package called KLU so KLU.jl is the clear choice. Looks like it's just about time for the 3 day mark so I'... | [JSON](../data/K/KLU-pr49410.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/K/KLU-pr49410-analysis.json) |
| LKH | #30852 | ✅ Merged | This package is a wrapper of the famous LKH library. http://webhotel4.ruc.dk/~keld/research/LKH/. Hence the name of the package is LKH.jl. | [JSON](../data/L/LKH-pr30852.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/L/LKH-pr30852-analysis.json) |
| LSL | #4256 | ✅ Merged | Can you retrigger to resolve the conflict? Also, how about calling this `LabStreamingLayer` (`LabStreamingLayers`?)  Edit: nvm, this was wrapping a lsl library. | [JSON](../data/L/LSL-pr4256.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/L/LSL-pr4256-analysis.json) |

| XRT | #114380 | ✅ Merged | [noblock] Being a wrapper, the name `XRT` seems okay to me, but it will need a manual merge.  Of course, the compat-issues have to be fixed. | [JSON](../data/X/XRT-pr114380.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/X/XRT-pr114380-analysis.json) |

| QML | #18516 | ✅ Merged | The version is 0.6 because the package existed before in the old registry | [JSON](../data/Q/QML-pr18516.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/Q/QML-pr18516-analysis.json) |
| SMC | #2892 | ✅ Merged | Although the name is perhaps not ideal, we've already committed to it for other reasons so we'd like to merge as is with the current name. | [JSON](../data/S/SMC-pr2892.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/S/SMC-pr2892-analysis.json) |

| XDF | #20235 | ✅ Merged | This package provides support for reading XDF files. Since it seems to be common practice to name such packages after the file format they support, I would like to keep the name XDF.jl | [JSON](../data/X/XDF-pr20235.json) | [Analysis](../analysis/X/XDF-pr20235-analysis.json) |
