I used Claude Code Sonnet 4.5 subagents to categorize each package into the 12 categories in categories.md. We first split into accepted/rejected so each subagent only had a 6-way categorization (which accepted/which rejected). Each subagent had a batch of 15. The initial categories were determined by mediocre heuristics with another script written by Claude. But all packages were individually assessed against categories.md by subagents.
