| Package | PR # | Status | Comments | Merged By | Key Reviewer | Comment | Data | Analysis |
|---------|------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------|------|----------|
| ABC | #36177 | ❌ Closed | 4 | — | — | — | [JSON](data/A/ABC-pr36177.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/ABC-pr36177-analysis.json) |
| ACS | #133925 | ❌ Closed | 4 | — | @goerz | I would not recommend `AmCommSurvey`. Long descriptive package names are strongly encouraged by the guidelines, and I don’t think `AmericanCommunitySurvey` is too long. | [JSON](data/A/ACS-pr133925.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/ACS-pr133925-analysis.json) |
| ADI | #19070 | ✅ Merged | 2 | @fredrikekre | — | — | [JSON](data/A/ADI-pr19070.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/ADI-pr19070-analysis.json) |
| AES | #13857 | ✅ Merged | 4 | @DilumAluthge | @DilumAluthge | I would recommend a longer name.<br><br>That being said, it is your package. | [JSON](data/A/AES-pr13857.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/AES-pr13857-analysis.json) |
| AGC | #26994 | ❌ Closed | 2 | — | @giordano | Besides all issues pointed out by AutoMerge (a more verbose name would greatly improve discoverability), this package has no license file | [JSON](data/A/AGC-pr26994.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/AGC-pr26994-analysis.json) |
| AGC | #27053 | ❌ Closed | 1 | — | — | — | [JSON](data/A/AGC-pr27053.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/AGC-pr27053-analysis.json) |
| AME | #93079 | ❌ Closed | 9 | — | @lgoettgens | I think this package's name contradicts the first naming rule "1. Avoid jargon. In particular, avoid acronyms unless there is minimal possibility of confusion.". It would be great if you could change the name to something more descriptive. Unfortunately, I could not find in your docs what "AME" is an abbreviation for, and so I am not able to give some suggestions. | [JSON](data/A/AME-pr93079.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/AME-pr93079-analysis.json) |
| AML | #4666 | ❌ Closed | 18 | — | @DilumAluthge | I have closed this PR as well as #4773. Now you can rename your package and register it under the new name. | [JSON](data/A/AML-pr4666.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/AML-pr4666-analysis.json) |
| AML | #4773 | ❌ Closed | 9 | — | @DilumAluthge | Closed per https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/4666#issuecomment-547597973 | [JSON](data/A/AML-pr4773.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/AML-pr4773-analysis.json) |
| AWS | #20506 | ✅ Merged | 24 | @fredrikekre | @oxinabox | This package should be exempt to the 5 letter rule as it is a pre-existing package with a name from long before that guideline that is only now being updated to be Julia 1.0 compatible. | [JSON](data/A/AWS-pr20506.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/AWS-pr20506-analysis.json) |
| Aim | #72183 | ❌ Closed | 3 | — | — | — | [JSON](data/A/Aim-pr72183.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/Aim-pr72183-analysis.json) |

| Ant | #1095 | ✅ Merged | 6 | @StefanKarpinski | @StefanKarpinski | Up to you. If you want to go with `Ant` that's ok too. Just retrigger when you're ready. | [JSON](data/A/Ant-pr1095.json) | [Analysis](analysis/A/Ant-pr1095-analysis.json) |

| BDD | #19448 | ❌ Closed | 7 | — | @fredrikekre | > As in, leave the repo as BDD.jl but have it on the general registry as BinaryDecisionDiagrams?<br><br>Sure, but why? Pretty confusing when they don't match. | [JSON](data/B/BDD-pr19448.json) | [Analysis](analysis/B/BDD-pr19448-analysis.json) |
| BEE | #13426 | ❌ Closed | 4 | — | @johnnychen94 | It's highly recommended to read and follow the practice of https://semver.org/ before registering your package.<br><br>The name `BEE` isn't appropriate because it's very likely you're the only one that knows what it means.<br><br>I believe the appropriate version is `v0.0.1` since your package is pretty new (3 days old).<br><br>> https://semver.org/#how-do-i-know-when-to-release-100<br>> If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0.

| CAP | #118365 | ✅ Merged | 8 | @carstenbauer | @carstenbauer | I agree with @goerz in that we should merge this although it's not optimal.<br><br>But one more question: Can we expect this to be the last short acronym named package from this area for the foreseeable future? | [JSON](data/C/CAP-pr118365.json) | [Analysis](analysis/C/CAP-pr118365-analysis.json) |

| CGA | #17640 | ❌ Closed | 3 | — | @chakravala | The name for this package isn't useful, since CGA can also stand for a lot of other things, like Conformal Geometric Algebra. | [JSON](data/C/CGA-pr17640.json) | [Analysis](analysis/C/CGA-pr17640-analysis.json) |

| CVI | #33276 | ❌ Closed | 4 | — | @giordano | Generally speaking we prefer long and descriptive names to short and hard-to-understand ones :wink:  After you rename the package, register it again and a new pull request will be opened.

| HGF | #67567 | ❌ Closed | 6 | — | @ViralBShah | It will be hard to reserve a 3 letter name in General. Honestly, not being in that community, I have no idea what this is. I recommend  "HierarchicalGaussianFilter.jl" or something that is at least longer. I know there are existing short names that got registered earlier, but can you reconsider? Is there any other option with HGF and a short suffix?<br><br>MATLAB doesn't have a global registry, and hence not an issue there.

| HSM | #120480 | ❌ Closed | 5 | — | @goerz | Congratulations on the new package! However, [as a general rule](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/dev/creating-packages/#Package-naming-guidelines-1), we would like to avoid acronyms in package names. Using `HierarchicalStateMachines.jl` as the name of this package should be totally fine. | [JSON](data/H/HSM-pr120480.json) | [Analysis](analysis/H/HSM-pr120480-analysis.json) |

| INT | #124856 | ❌ Closed | 5 | — | @goerz | The most obvious and appropriate name for this would be `IntrinsicNeuralTimescales`. Long and descriptive names like that are strongly encourage by the community (unlike in other languages, maybe), while acronyms are heavily frowned upon. So writing out acronyms like `INT` is usually the way to go. | [JSON](data/I/INT-pr124856.json) | [Analysis](analysis/I/INT-pr124856-analysis.json) |

| SMM | #1536 | ✅ Merged | 9 | @fredrikekre | @fredrikekre | > Should I not specify a logger at all?<br><br>IMO a package should not set the global logger, for example, if in my code I have<br>```<br>my_logger = ...<br>using SMM<br>???<br>```<br>loading your package changes my own set logger. So I think setting loggers is only for top level applications, not for packages.
